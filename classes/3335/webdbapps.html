3335 focuses on teaching a series of principles and techniques for
data management applications.  There is not sufficient time in the
class to provide the instruction on specific technologies necessary
for developing a complete database application with a web front-end.
For very motivated students wishing to explore these technologies on
their own, we provide guidance in learning a
core set of specific technologies, which demonstrates <b>one</b> of
the technology paths for developing such applications.  This
instruction will not be sufficient for development of production
Web/DB applications.  It is only intended to provide a survey of
specific technologies used in such systems.<P>

This page provides an outline for the progression through this
material and a source of book and online information.  If you find a
book or online resource that you think is helpful, please me email so
I can add a link to this page.
