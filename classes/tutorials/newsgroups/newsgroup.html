</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>Ever encountered a problem and thought "I know the solution is simple. If only I could find some who has dealt with this problem before, she could answer my question in a few seconds." The problem is how to contact this ethereal person. Email will not work because...well you don't know who it is so you sure don't know their email address. The web is this giant, unfocused jumble of (semi-)interrelated information. Is there a web page that deals with your problem? Hard to tell. </P>
<P>The answer is (perhaps) newsgroups! Newsgroups are basically cyber coffee houses where people with common interests gather to exchange ideas. Each table in the coffee house represents a group with highly specialized interest. All you have to do is stroll into this coffee house and sit down at the table to be privy to the insight (and ramblings) of the experts (and idiots) in your interest area. Perhaps you will overhear the answer to your questions while sitting quietly at the table (reading newsgroup). If that does not work, you may speak up and ask your question to the group (posting to a newsgroup). </P>
<P>So how do find which table fits your needs? You're in luck! All of the tables are conveniently labeled with a sign describing its group's interests. One such table is named humanities.languages.sanskrit. Clearly, this group will discuss issues which are not of interest to the general public. That's good because if you are interested in Sanskrit you don't want to listen to people who find Hieroglyphics interesting. Note that newsgroup names are hierarchically organized by subject. The most general subject area (e.g. Humanities) is listed first. The next most general subject area (e.g. Languages) is listed next, separated by a "dot" from the first. </P>
<P>Well then, how do you access these wonderful islands of like-minds? All you need is a news reader. This is program that will download the comments people have posted to the newsgroup(s) in which you are interested. Many news readers exist, and they all work on the same principles. Here we describe using the Netscape news reader (specifically Communicator 4.5 under Windows), but the steps should be applicable to any news reader: </P>

<LI>First, bring up the Netscape newsreader by selecting "Newsgroups" from the "Communicator" menu: </LI>
</FONT><P><IMG SRC="Image10.gif" WIDTH=571 HEIGHT=509></P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>It should look like this</P>
</FONT><P><IMG SRC="Image11.gif" WIDTH=577 HEIGHT=408></P>
<P><IMG SRC="Image12.gif" WIDTH=577 HEIGHT=408></P>
<FONT SIZE=2><LI>Newsgroup messages look like email except they are addressed to the group rather than an individual. You need to specify a newsgroup server from which to download these messages. To do this in Netscape, choose "Preferences" under the Edit menu. Make sure that the "Mail &amp; Newsgroups" category is opened, and then select "Newsgroup Servers." This should look like:</LI>
</FONT><P><IMG SRC="Image13.gif" WIDTH=545 HEIGHT=459></P>
<FONT SIZE=2><LI>Click on the "Add..." button to add a new newsgroup server. In the "Server" box, type "bunews.baylor.edu." This is the name of the Baylor newsgroup server. Also, check the box labeled "Always use name and password." The Baylor server expects you to use your BearID and password for access to newsgroups. The pop-up box should look like this:</LI>
</FONT><P><IMG SRC="Image14.gif" WIDTH=285 HEIGHT=189></P>
<FONT SIZE=2><LI>Click "OK" boxes until you are out of the "Preferences" dialog box. Your list of servers should now include "bunews.baylor.edu" in the left pane of the box.</LI>
<LI>Choose "Subscribe.." from the File menu. This will bring up a hierarchically organized list of newsgroups. Find the newsgroups you wish, clicking on the "Subscribe" button after highlighting the newsgroup. In the example below I have subscribed to "baylor.acad.csi.4321". Click "OK" to close the box when done.</LI>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;</P>
<LI>Select the newsgroup you wish to read as in</LI>
</FONT><P><IMG SRC="Image16.gif" WIDTH=577 HEIGHT=408></P>
<FONT SIZE=2><LI>You may now read the individual message you choose.</LI>
<LI>To get new messages, click on the "Get Msg" button at the top of the reader. To post a message, you may either reply to an existing message ("Reply" button) or post an entirely new message ("New Msg" button).</LI></OL>
