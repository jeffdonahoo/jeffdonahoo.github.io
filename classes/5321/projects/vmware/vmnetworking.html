    <td colspan="7" valign="top"><br> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You 
      will have the option of selecting the type of networking you want for your 
      virtual machine when you use the <strong>New Virtual Machine Wizard</strong>. 
      You can later edit this option by going to <strong>Edit&gt;Virtual Machine 
      Setting</strong>s for that particular virtual machine. 
      <p>The standard networking options that VMWare Workstation currently provides 
        are<br>
        - Bridged networking<br>
        - Network Address Translation(NAT)<br>
        - Host-Only Networking</p>
      </font> <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following 
        is a brief explanation of these options and how you can set them, but 
        it is strongly recommended that you read the Networking section of your 
        VMWare product documentation before you use any of these options.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Bridged networking</strong><br>
        Bridged Networking is the default option that VMWare sets up for your 
        new virtual machine. If you use bridged networking, your virtual machine 
        needs to have its own identity on the network. For example, on a TCP/IP 
        network, the virtual machine needs its own IP address. The virtual machine 
        is a full participant in the network. It has access to other machines 
        on the network and can be contacted by other machines on the network as 
        if it were a physical computer on the network. <br>
        <strong><br>
        Network Address Translation</strong><br>
        NAT gives a virtual machine access to network resources using the host 
        computer's IP address. A network address translation connection is set 
        up automatically if you follow the Custom path in the New Virtual Machine 
        Wizard and select Use network address translation. <br>
        <br>
        If you use NAT, your virtual machine does not have its own IP address 
        on the external network. Instead, a separate private network is set up 
        on the host computer. Your virtual machine gets an address on that network 
        from the VMware virtual DHCP server. The VMware NAT device passes network 
        data between one or more virtual machines and the external network. It 
        identifies incoming data packets intended for each virtual machine and 
        sends them to the correct destination. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Host-Only Networking</strong><br>
        Host-only networking creates a network that is completely contained within 
        the host computer.A host-only network is set up automatically if you select 
        <strong>Use Host-Only Networking</strong> in the <strong>New Virtual Machine 
        Wizard</strong>.<br>
        <br>
        Host-only networking provides a network connection between the virtual 
        machine and the host computer, using a virtual Ethernet adapter that is 
        visible to the host operating system. This approach can be useful if you 
        need to set up an isolated virtual network. If you use host-only networking, 
        your virtual machine and the host virtual adapter are connected to a private 
        TCP/IP network. Addresses on this network are provided by the VMware DHCP 
        server. </font><br>
