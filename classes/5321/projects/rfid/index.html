			<h4>Background</h4>
			<a href="http://www.ti.com" title="TI Website">Texas Instruments</a> (TI) is a leader in 
			<a href="http://www.ti-rfid.com" title="TI's RFID Website">Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)</a>
			technology.	RFID consists of a transceiver (transmitter/receiver) and transponders.  The transponders
			come in many shapes and sizes, and can be embedded in a credit card or hidden within the seam of a garment.
			Some are active (embedded power source) but most are passive, activated and powered only by the 13.56MHz 
			carrier signal from the transceiver.  TI manufactures both Tag-it (proprietary) and ISO-15963 transponders.
			Most, if not all, of TI's transceivers can address either type of transponder.

			<h4>S6350</h4>
			We have acquired an evaluation kit from TI containing the <a href="RI-STU-TRDC-02.pdf" 
			title="S6350 spec sheet">TI S6350 transceiver</a>, several Tag-it transponders, and 
			several ISO transponders.  The S6350 is designed to communicate as a slave over RS-232 
			to a master host.  As shipped, its effective range is about 3 inches.  Part of our research involves
			developing a loop antenna (using <a href="HFcookbook.pdf" title="TI's HF Antenna Cookbook">
			this reference</a>), but it was not completed in time to be included in this report.  
			To make effective use of the S6350, programmatically, requires continuous polling via
			RS-232 from the host computer.  Communication is achieved by sending packets of bytes
			to the S6350, then immediately reading the response.  <a href="RI-STU-TRDCrefGuide.pdf" 
			title="Protocol Definition for TI S6350 RFID Reader">Detailed information</a> about the S6350's
			command language is available from the <a href="http://www.ti.com/tiris/docs/docntr.htm"

			<h4>RFID API</h4>
			We have developed a user library in C# for TI's S6350 evaluation kit.  Our library provides 
			object oriented command encapsulation as well as a transport mechanism for RS-232 communication.
			As of this writing, only a subset of the Tag-it commands are represented.  We have not included
			any of the ISO commands.  However, extending the library to cover the remaining Tag-it commands
			as well as the ISO commands should require minimal effort.

			<h4>Serial Protocol and Packet Definition</h4>
			As mentioned in the <a href="RI-STU-TRDCrefGuide.pdf" title="Protocol Defintion for TI S6350 RFID Reader">
			S6350 documentation</a>, the S6350 uses RS-232 configured as follows: 1 start bit, 8 data bits,
			1 stop bit, no parity, and baud rate configurable to 9600, 19200, 38400, or 57600.<br>
			<br>
			The host computer initiates all communication with the S6350.  Communication sequences consist
			of request/response pairs where the hosts waits for the reponse before continuing.  The following
			chart demonstrates the format of a request packet. (The node address is ignored by the S6350.)<br>
			<br>
			<img src="request_packet.gif" border="1" width="538" height="544" alt="Request Packet format"><br>
			<strong><em><font size="-1">Request Packet format (Host to Reader)</font></em></strong><br>
			<br>
			The request packet consists of a seven byte header, a variable length data section, and a two byte trailer.  The command flag has
			two legal values (0x00 and 0x10), since all but one bit are reserved for future definition.  When
			bit 4 is set, the request is addressed to the transponder specified by the data section of 
			the request packet.  Otherwise, the request applies to any transponder within range of the reader.
			For response packets (details below), the command flag is used to indicate error condition (0x10 
			indicates error, with specific error codes encoded in the data section of the response packet).
			The <strong>BCC</strong> (block check character) consists of a one byte <strong>LRC</strong> (longitudinal Redundancy Check) and 
			one byte of the ones-complement of the <strong>LRC</strong>.  The <strong>LRC</strong> is a cumulative XOR calculated over the 
			entire packet.  Request packets and response packets each require a <strong>BCC</strong> trailer.<br>

			<strong><em><font size="-1">Response Packet format (Reader to Host)</font></em></strong><br>
			<br>
			Of the twelve Tag-it commands set forth, we have implemented five: <em>Read Single Block</em>, 
			<em>Write Single Block</em>, <em>Special Read Block</em>, <em>Reader Version</em>, and 
			<em>Read Transponder Details</em>.<br>

			<h4>Code Design, Acknowledgments</h4>
			C# allows for excellent object oriented design.  Using an Abstract Factory design pattern,
			(modeled after code graciously supplied to the authors by our mentor, 
			<a href="http://cs.baylor.edu/~donahoo" title="Rockin'est Networking Site on the Web">Dr. Jeff Donahoo</a>)
			we have implemented the following class hierarchy.  Byte arrays are exposed by serialize() methods, and
			class instances are returned by static deserialize() methods.<br>
			<br>

			The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/02/10/netserialcomm/" 
			title="NetSerialComm Library from MSDN Mag">serial communication API</a> we used is borrowed from 
			John Hind, who published his NetSerialComm library in the 
			October 2002 MSDN Magazine.  The NetSerialComm API provides for sending and receiving byte-at-a-time 
			communication via RS232.  John's article walks the reader through extending his API towards more specific 
			application.  Our packet transaction model (RFIDComm) is not very different from example code posted 
			on MSDN.  Thanks, John!<br>
			<br>
			The packet transaction model (type signature shown below)
			<blockquote>
				<font face="Courier" color="#0000ff">public static Packet TransactPacket(Packet request)</font>
			</blockquote>
			merges knowledge of RFID command packet formatting with an extension of the NetSerialComm API.  
			The NetSerialComm API uses overlapped I/O (which uses callback funtions) for asynchronous communication.
			Given that the packet size is encoded within the first three bytes of each packet, the callback member 
			function in RFIDComm signals the Transact() thread upon completion of the packet, which terminates its 
			wait state upon receiving the signal, and returns the Packet it receives to the calling application.

			<h4>Implementation</h4>
			To facilitate ease of use, we have combined several basic operations into static helper functions
			accessible via the <font face="Courier" color="#0000ff">RFIDUtil</font> class.  A brief discussion
			of these helper methods follows.<br>
			<br>
			First of all, however, it is worth noting the default assumptions made by the RFIDUtil helper class.
			The default com port starts at "COM1:".  This can be changed by accessing 
			<font face="Courier" color="#0000ff">public static string RFIDUtil.comPort</font> and setting it to 
			the desired com port prior to invoking any of the helper methods.  The default timeout, accessible via 
			<font face="Courier" color="#0000ff">public static uint RFIDUtil.timeOut</font>, starts at 500 ms.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
				<blockquote>
					<font face="Courier" color="#0000ff">public static bool WriteBlock( DataBlock db )</font><br>
					<blockquote>
						The DataBlock class encapsulates a four byte data block, the one byte block number, and
						in the context of a response packet, the lock status corresponding to this block.  The
						user instantiates a DataBlock object, sets the Buffer member with four bytes of data, sets 
						the BlockNum member with the desired block to be written to, then passes this object
						to the WriteBlock() method.  On success, the return value is true; otherwise, false.
					</blockquote>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<font face="Courier" color="#0000ff">public static bool WriteBlock( uint TransponderID, DataBlock db )</font><br>
					<blockquote>
						Using the DataBlock object mentioned above, the user can specify <strong><em>which</em></strong> 
						RFID to write to, by setting TransponderID to the RFID's unique identifier.
					</blockquote>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<font face="Courier" color="#0000ff">public static bool ZeroRFID( string zero )</font><br>
					<blockquote>
						We have empirically observed that most RFIDs are initialized to a "zero" pattern of 5s 
						(ie, "55 55 55 55").  For the user's convenience, we have provided a helper method to 
						reinitialize an RFID back to whatever zero pattern of choice.  All eight blocks are 
						written with the zero pattern.
					</blockquote>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<font face="Courier" color="#0000ff">public static bool ZeroRFID( uint TransponderID, string zero )</font><br>
					<blockquote>
						This helper method is identical to the method above, except that the RFID serial number may
						be specified so that only that RFID is zeroed.
					</blockquote>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<font face="Courier" color="#0000ff">public static Special_Read_Block ReadAllBlocks()</font><br>
					<blockquote>
						Any RFID in range is queried for all eight data blocks (four bytes each) for a total
						payload of six by eight, or forty-eight bytes.  The Special_Read_Block object is set
						with the RFID's Transponder ID, and each of the Special_Read_Block's eight DataBlock
						objects contains the corresponding data block, block number, and lock status of the
						RFID's data blocks.  These accessors are explained in depth in the commented source code
						of Special_Read_Block and PackettagIt.

			<h4>Scenario</h4>
			To help flesh out an implementation of our RFID API, we have come up with the following scenario:
			A store owner wishes to take inventory of RFID-equipped crates using the S6350 reader.  If a crate
			has already been marked into the store's inventory, the RFID will contain the store's four-byte 
			identifier (conversely, the store's database will already contain the RFID's unique serial number,
			but we have not tied in any database code to our small demonstration project).  If the crate has
			no remaining empty blocks to write into, the inventory function fails.  Otherwise, the store ID is
			written to the first available data block on the crate's RFID.<br>
			<br>
			If you want to play around with an S6350, download the source code (linked below) and run the 
			RFIDComm.exe in the bin\Debug folder.  (You must have the .NET Runtime installed to execute this 
			binary.  You may have to update your Runtime to match the dependencies of this executable.)  Invoke
			"RFIDComm.exe -?" to see a detailed help screen (shown below).<br>

			<h4>How do I make it work?</h4>
			These instructions assume you have the TI S6350 evaluation kit.<br>
			<br>
			To use the S6350 and the various sample RFID transponders (tiny IC chips in a floppy plastic
			sheath with a spiraled antenna), you will need power to the transceiver, and communication from 
			the transceiver to the PC host controller.  For power, assemble the AC adapter with the US prongs.  
			The S6350 transceiver is about the size of a cigar box -- plug in the DC pigtail of the AC adapter 
			into the transceiver.  Now find the serial cable: you need a cable about 6 feet long, with one end 
			as 9 pin male, and the other end as 9 pin female. Connect the male end to the transceiver, and the 
			female end to your PC.  (Pay attention to whether you use COM1 or COM2, that's important.)<br>
			<br>
			To compile the source, you will either need Visual Studio.NET 2003, or you will need to have
			the .NET runtime installed.  If you use Visual Studio.NET to run and debug our source code, don't
			forget to set the command line parameters in the Debug settings.  To compile our source code with
			only the .NET runtime installed, you must first find the C# compiler, csc.exe:
			<blockquote>
				<font face="Courier" color="#0000ff">
					cd %WINDIR%<br>
					cd Microsoft.NET<br>
					cd Framework<br>
					dir /ad&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>(look for the latest version number)</em><br>
					cd &lt;latest version number&gt;<br>
					dir csc.exe<br>
				</font>
			</blockquote>
			Once you've found csc.exe, call it from your source code directory to compile the program:
			<blockquote>
				<font face="Courier" color="#0000ff">
					%WINDIR%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\&lt;latest version number&gt;\csc.exe *.cs
				</font>
			</blockquote>
			Remember which COM port you plugged into?  If it's COM1, you don't have to worry about it, that's
			the default.  Otherwise, if your store ID is 0xAABBCCDD, run the program like so:
			<blockquote>
				<font face="Courier" color="#0000ff">
					RFIDComm.exe "aa bb cc dd" &lt;your COM port&gt;
				</font>
			</blockquote>
			Now, any TI TagIt transponder you wave over the S6350 transceiver will have its first available
			four-byte block written with AA BB CC DD, and its unique Transponder ID will be echoed to your
			console.
