The following are instructions for installing and running the FreeOxy server:

1. Download the FreeOxy proxy server from xxx. If you are reading this document, you
   have probably done that already.
2. Double-click on the xxx.jar file. That should start up your FreeOxy server.
3. Now, configure your browser to use a proxy at 127.0.0.1:27322(The default port that 
   is used by the proxy). In IE, go to Tools/Internet/LAN Settings/Use a proxy server.
   Look at the browser documentation for other browsers.
4. That should be it! You are now a member of the FreeOxy community. You can now 'breathe
   the freedom of the net' and also help your oppressed peers do the same.

Trouble-shooting

Problem: You get a "Connection refused" message(you will not be able to 
	connect to the website you wish to go to).
Solution: Try refreshing the browser a few times. The FreeOxy project 
	depends entirely on the individual users on the internet running the FreeOxy servers.
	There might be a few proxies which go down, and you might try to connect to them before 
	your proxy realizes that they are down, which would cause the above problem. A future 
	version would automatically redirect requests to a FreeOxy server which is up. There is 
	the chance that all the FreeOxy servers out there might be down, but we expect the probability 
	of this happening to diminish as the number of FreeOxy users increases.
