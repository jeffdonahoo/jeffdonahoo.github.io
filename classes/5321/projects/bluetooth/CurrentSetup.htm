<p class="Topic">Using Nuggets</p>
<p class="Text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="Text">Nuggets as
currently implemented is fairly easy to use.  Simply run at least one
client-server pair on 2 different hosts.  Currently, only Moe and
Curly have the necessary configuration to support bluetooth.  For this
example Nuggets session we will assume that Moe runs the client and
Curly runs the server.  Firstly, on Curly, change the directory to
/root/nuggets and then run ./runBrowser.sh.  Then, on Moe, change the
directory to /root/nuggets.  Next, change the contents of the file
called 'nugget' to whatever you wish the nugget to be and run
./runClient.sh.</span></p>
<p class="Topic">Troubleshooting Q & A</p>
<p class="Text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Q. Nuggets
doesn't work!</b><br>
<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A. </b>That's not really a question you
 know.  There could be a couple of reasons that nuggets is failing to
 work, though.  First, make certain that the hci and sdp daemons are
 running (see <a href="Setup.htm">System Setup</a>)  Finally, make
 certain that the bluetooth dongles are actually up.  To do this, type
 hciconfig and look in the output for "...UP RUNNING...".  If instead
 you see something like "...DOWN...", then the bluetooth dongle on
 that computer is not up.  To bring it up, type hciconfig hci0 up.  Be
 sure to check that the dongle is now up by typing hciconfig.</p>
