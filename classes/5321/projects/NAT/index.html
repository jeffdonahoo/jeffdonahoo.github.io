    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">NAT is sometimes 
      referred to as Transparent Proxying, IP Address Overloading, or IP Masquerading. 
      You'll know why, when you look at the NAT operation.</font></p>
  </div>
</div>
<div align="left"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> 
  The Internet is expanding at an exponential rate. As the amount of information 
  and resources increases, it is becoming a requirement for even the smallest 
  businesses and homes to connect to the Internet. NAT is a method of connecting 
  multiple computers to the Internet (or any other IP network) using one IP address. 
  This allows home users and small businesses to connect their network to the 
  Internet cheaply and efficiently. </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">In an IP network, 
    each computer is allocated a unique IP address. In the current version of 
    IP protocol, IP version 4, an IP address is 4 bytes. Since an address is 4 
    bytes, the total number of available addresses is 2 to the power of 32 = 4,294,967,296. 
    This represents the total theoretical number of computers that can be directly 
    connected to the Internet. In practice, the real limit is much smaller for 
    several reasons. The actual number of available addresses is smaller (somewhere 
    between 3.2 and 3.3 billion) because of the way that the addresses are separated 
    into classes, and because some addresses are set aside for multicasting, testing 
    or other special uses. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">While the number 
    of available addresses seems large, the Internet is growing at such a pace 
    that it will soon be exhausted. While the next generation IP protocol, IP 
    version 6, allows for larger addresses, it will take years before the existing 
    network infrastructure migrates to the new protocol. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Because IP addresses 
    are a scarce resource, most Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will only allocate 
    one address to a single customer. In majority of cases this address is assigned 
    dynamically, so every time a client connects to the ISP a different address 
    will be provided. Big companies can buy more addresses, but for small businesses 
    and home users the cost of doing so is prohibitive. Because such users are 
    given only one IP address, they can have only one computer connected to the 
    Internet at one time. With an NAT gateway running on this single computer, 
    it is possible to share that single address between multiple local computers 
    and connect them all at the same time. The outside world is unaware of this 
    division and thinks that only one computer is connected. </font></p>

  <pre><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="5">Forms of NAT:</font></b></font></pre>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Static NAT</b> 
    - Mapping an unregistered IP address on your internal network to a registered 
    IP address on a one-to-one basis. Particularly useful when a device needs 
    to be accessible from outside the network. </font></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Dynamic NAT</b> - Maps 
    an unregistered IP address on your internal network to a registered IP address 
    from a group of registered IP addresses.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Overloading</b> - A 
    form of dynamic NAT that maps multiple unregistered IP addresses to a single 
    registered IP address by using different ports. This is known also as PAT 
    (Port Address Translation), single address NAT or port-level multiplexed NAT. 
    We discuss this form in the next section.<br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Overlapping</b> - When 
    the IP addresses used on your internal network are registered IP addresses 
    in use on another network, the router must maintain a lookup table of these 
    addresses so that it can intercept them and replace them with registered unique 
    IP addresses. It is important to note that the NAT router must translate the 
    &quot;internal&quot; addresses to registered unique addresses as well as translate 
    the &quot;external&quot; registered addresses to addresses that are unique 
    to the private network. This can be done either through static NAT or by using 
    DNS and implementing dynamic NAT. <br>
    </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5"><b>NAT Operation:</b></font></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The basic purpose 
      of NAT is to multiplex traffic from the internal network and present it 
      to the Internet as if it was coming from a single computer having only one 
      IP address. </font> </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The TCP/IP 
      protocols include a multiplexing facility so that any computer can maintain 
      multiple simultaneous connections with a remote computer. It is this multiplexing 
      facility that is the key to single address NAT. To multiplex several connections 
      to a single destination, client computers label all packets with unique 
      &quot;port numbers&quot;. Each IP packet starts with a header containing 
      the source and destination addresses and port numbers: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><i>Source address</i> 
      <i>- Source port</i> <i>- Destination address - Destination port </i></font></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">This combination 
      of numbers completely defines a single TCP/IP connection. The addresses 
      specify the two machines at each end, and the two port numbers ensure that 
      each connection between this pair of machines can be uniquely identified. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Each separate 
      connection is originated from a unique source port number in the client, 
      and all reply packets from the remote server for this connection contain 
      the same number as their destination port, so that the client can relate 
      them back to its correct connection. In this way, for example, it is possible 
      for a web browser to ask a web server for several images at once and to 
      know how to put all the parts of all the responses back together. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">A modern NAT 
      gateway must change the Source address on every outgoing packet to be its 
      single public address. It therefore also renumbers the Source Ports to be 
      unique, so that it can keep track of each client connection. The NAT gateway 
      uses a <i>port mapping table</i> to remember how it renumbered the ports 
      for each client's outgoing packets. The <i>port mapping table</i> relates 
      the client's real local IP address and source port plus its translated source 
      port number to a destination address and port. The NAT gateway can therefore 
      reverse the process for returning packets and route them back to the correct 
      clients. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">When any remote 
      server responds to an NAT client, incoming packets arriving at the NAT gateway 
      will all have the same Destination address, but the destination Port number 
      will be the unique Source Port number that was assigned by the NAT. The 
      NAT gateway looks in its <i>port mapping table</i> to determine which &quot;real&quot; 
      client address and port number a packet is destined for, and replaces these 
      numbers before passing the packet on to the local client. This process is 
      completely dynamic. When a packet is received from an internal client, NAT 
      looks for the matching source address and port in the port mapping table. 
      If the entry is not found, a new one is created, and a new mapping port 
      allocated to the client:</font></p>

  </ul>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Each client 
      has an idle time-out associated with it. Whenever new traffic is received 
      for a client, its time-out is reset. When the time-out expires, the client 
      is removed from the table. This ensures that the table is kept to a reasonable 
      size. The length of the time-out varies, but taking into account traffic 
      variations on the Internet should not go below 2-3 minutes. Most NAT implementations 
      can also track TCP clients on a per-connection basis and remove them from 
      the table as soon as the connection is closed. This is not possible for 
      UDP traffic since it is not connection based. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Many higher-level 
      TCP/IP protocols embed client addressing information in the packets. For 
      example, during an &quot;active&quot; FTP transfer the client informs the 
      server of its IP address &amp; port number, and then waits for the server 
      to open a connection to that address. NAT has to monitor these packets and 
      modify them on the fly to replace the client's IP address (which is on the 
      internal network) with the NAT address. Since this changes the length of 
      the packet, the TCP sequence/acknowledge numbers must be modified as well. 
      Most protocols can be supported within the NAT; some protocols, however, 
      may require that the clients themselves are made aware of the NAT and that 
      they participate in the address translation process. [Or the NAT must be 
      protocol-sensitive so that it can monitor or modify the embedded address 
      or port data] </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Because the 
      port mapping table relates complete connection information - source and 
      destination address and port numbers - it is possible to validate any or 
      all of this information before passing incoming packets back to the client. 
      This checking helps to provide effective firewall protection against Internet-launched 
      attacks on the private LAN. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Each IP packet 
      also contain checksums that are calculated by the originator. They are recalculated 
      and compared by the recipient to see if the packet has been corrupted in 
      transit. The checksums depend on the contents of the packet. Since the NAT 
      must modify the packet addresses and port numbers, it must also recalculate 
      and replace the checksums. Careful design in the NAT software can ensure 
      that this extra processing has a minimal effect on the gateway's throughput. 
      Before doing so it must check for, and discard, any corrupt packets to avoid 
      converting a bad packet into a good one. </font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </div>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3"><b><font size="5">Uses 
    of NAT:</font></b></font></font></p>
  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Security: </b><br>
  </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are a number of 
    security issues related to the Internet. Most personal computer operating 
    systems are not designed with security in mind, leaving them wide open to 
    attacks from the Internet. For example, it is now possible for an applet 
    or Active X control to take control of a computer it is running on. Many times 
    it is not even possible to detect that such applets are running. The security 
    implications of this are very serious. For home users, this means that sensitive 
    personal information, such as emails, correspondence or financial details 
    (such as credit card or cheque numbers) can be stolen. For business users 
    the consequences can be disastrous.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To combat the security 
    problem, a number of firewall products are available. They are placed between 
    the user and the Internet and verify all traffic before allowing it to pass 
    through. This means, for example, that no unauthorised user would be allowed 
    to access the company's file or email server. The problem with firewall solutions 
    is that they are expensive and difficult to set up and maintain, putting them 
    out of reach for home and small business users. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NAT automatically provides 
    firewall-style protection without any special set-up. That is because it only 
    allows connections that are originated on the inside network. This means, 
    for example, that an internal client can connect to an outside FTP server, 
    but an outside client will not be able to connect to an internal FTP server 
    because it would have to originate the connection, and NAT will not allow 
    that. It is still possible to make some internal servers available to the 
    outside world via inbound mapping, which maps certain well known TCP ports 
    (e.g.. 21 for FTP) to specific internal addresses, thus making services such 
    as FTP or Web available in a controlled way. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many TCP/IP stacks are 
    susceptible to low-level protocol attacks such as the recently-publicised 
    &quot;SYN flood&quot; or &quot;Ping of Death&quot;. These attacks do not compromise 
    the security of the computer, but can cause the servers to crash, resulting 
    in potentially damaging &quot;denials of service&quot;. Such attacks can cause 
    abnormal network events that can be used as a precursor or cloak for further 
    security breaches. NATs that do not use the host machine protocol stack but 
    supply their own can provide protection from such attacks: </font></p>
  <p></p>
  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Administration:</b><br>
  </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">IP networks are more difficult 
    to set up than local desktop LANs; each computer requires an IP address, a 
    subnet mask, DNS address, domain name, and a default router. This information 
    has to be entered on every computer on the network; if only one piece of information 
    is wrong, the network connection will not function and there is usually no 
    indication of what is wrong. In bigger networks the task of co-ordinating 
    the distribution of addresses and dividing the network into subnets is so 
    complicated that it requires a dedicated network administrator. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NAT can help network administration 
    in several ways: </font></p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It can divide a large 
    network into several smaller ones. The smaller parts expose only one IP address 
    to the outside, which means that computers can be added or removed, or their 
    addresses changed, without impacting external networks. With inbound mapping, 
    it is even possible to move services (such as Web servers) to a different 
    computer without having to do any changes on external clients.</font></li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some 
      modern NAT gateways contain a dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) 
      server. DHCP allows client computers to be configured automatically; when 
      a computer is switched on, it searches for a DHCP server and obtains TCP/IP 
      setup information. Changes to network configuration are done centrally at 
      the server and affect all the clients; the administrator does not need to 
      apply the change to every computer in the network. For example, if the DNS 
      server address changes, all clients will automatically start using the new 
      address the next time they contact the DHCP server. </font></div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many 
      NAT gateways provide for a way to restrict access to the Internet. For example, 
      Vicomsoft InterGate has built-in CyberPatrol filtering, which allows administrators 
      to prohibit access to dubious material. </font></div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another 
      useful feature is traffic logging; since all the traffic to and from the 
      Internet has to pass through a NAT gateway, it can record all the traffic 
      to a log file. This file can be used to generate various traffic reports, 
      such as traffic breakdown by user, by site, by network connection etc. </font></div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since 
      NAT gateways operate on IP packet-level, most of them have built-in internetwork 
      routing capability. The internetwork they are serving can be divided into 
      several separate sub networks (either using different backbones or sharing 
      the same backbone) which further simplifies network administration and allows 
      more computers to be connected to the network: </font></div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div align="left"> 
  <p> </p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To summarise, a NAT gateway 
    can provide the following benefits:<br>

<ul>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Firewall

<div align="left"> 
  <p></p>
  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Proxies</b>: <br>
  </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A proxy is any device 
    that acts on behalf of another. The term is most often used to denote Web 
    proxying. A Web proxy acts as a &quot;half-way&quot; Web server: network clients 
    make requests to the proxy, which then makes requests on their behalf to the 
    appropriate Web server. Proxy technology is often seen as an alternative way 
    to provide shared access to a single Internet connection. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main benefits of Web 
    proxying are: </font></p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Local 
      caching: a proxy can store frequently-accessed pages on its local hard disk; 
      when these pages are requested, it can serve them from its local files instead 
      of having to download the data from a remote Web server. Proxies that perform 
      caching are often called caching proxy servers. </font></div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Network 
      bandwidth conservation: if more than one client requests the same page, 
      the proxy can make one request only to a remote server and distribute the 
      received data to all waiting clients. </font></div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div align="left"> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both these benefits only 
    become apparent in situations where multiple clients are very likely to access 
    the same sites and so share the same data. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unlike NAT, Web proxying 
    is not a transparent operation: it must be explicitly supported by its clients. 
    Due to early adoption of Web proxying, most browsers, including Internet Explorer 
    and Netscape Communicator, have built-in support for proxies, but this must 
    normally be configured on each client machine, and may be changed by the naive 
    or malicious user. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Web proxying has the following 
    disadvantages: </font></p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Web content 
      is becoming more and more dynamic, with new developments such as streaming 
      video &amp; audio being widely used. Most of the new data formats are not 
      cacheable, eliminating one of the main benefits of proxying. </font></div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clients 
      have to be explicitly set to use Web proxying; whenever there is a change 
      (e.g. proxy is moved to a new IP address) each and every client has to be 
      set up again. </font></div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A proxy 
      server operates above the TCP level and uses the machine's built-in protocol 
      stack. For each Web request from a client, a TCP connection has to be established 
      between the client and the proxy machine, and another connection between 
      the proxy machine and the remote Web server. This puts lot of strain on 
      the proxy server machine; in fact, since Web pages are becoming more and 
      more complicated the proxy itself may become bottleneck on the network. 
      This contrasts with a NAT which operates on packet level and requires much 
      less processing for each connection. <br>
