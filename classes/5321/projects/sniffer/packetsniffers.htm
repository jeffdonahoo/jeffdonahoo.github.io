</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A Packet Sniffer is a program that can record
  all network packets that travel past a given network interface, on a given
  computer, on a network. It can be used to troubleshoot network problems, as
  well as to extract sensitive information such as Credentials from unencrypted
  Login Session's.</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A sniffer is a program that monitors and
  analyzes network traffic, detecting bottlenecks and problems. Using this
  information, a network manager can keep traffic flowing efficiently.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A sniffer can also be used illegitimately to
  capture data being transmitted on a network. A network <a href="http://whatis.com/router.htm">router</a>
  reads every <a href="http://whatis.com/packet.htm">packet</a> of data passed
  to it, determining whether it is intended for a destination within the
  router's own network or whether it should be passed further along the
  Internet. A router with a sniffer, however, may be able to read the data in
  the packet as well as the source and destination addresses.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The term &quot;sniffer&quot; is occasionally
  used for a program that analyzes data other than network traffic. For example,
  a database could be analyzed for certain kinds of duplication.</font></p>

    sniffer is and how it works</font></strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unlike telephone circuits, computer networks
  are shared communication channels. It is simply too expensive to dedicate
  local loops to the switch (hub) for each pair of communicating computers.
  Sharing means that computers can receive information that was intended for
  other machines. To capture the information going over the network is called
  sniffing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Most popular way of connecting computers is
  through Ethernet. Ethernet protocol works by sending packet information to all
  the hosts on the same circuit. The packet header contains the proper address
  of the destination machine. Only the machine with the matching address is
  suppose to accept the packet. A machine that is accepting all packets, no
  matter what the packet header says, is said to be in promiscuous mode.</font></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><strong><font color="#0080ff" face="Times New Roman">Sniffer</font></strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because, in a normal networking environment,
  account and password information is passed along Ethernet in clear-text, it is
  not hard for an intruder once they obtain root to put a machine into
  promiscuous mode and by sniffing, compromise all the machines on the net.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A program and/or device that monitors data
  traveling over a network. Sniffers can be used both for legitimate network
  management functions and for stealing information off a network. Unauthorized
  sniffers can be extremely dangerous to a network's security because they are
  virtually impossible to detect and can be inserted almost anywhere. This makes
  them a favorite weapon in the hacker's arsenal.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">On TCP/IP networks, where they sniff packets,
  they're often called <i>packet sniffers.</i></font></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The popularity of packet sniffing stems from the fact that it sees <i>everything</i>.
Typical items sniffed include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>SMTP, POP, IMAP traffic</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Allows intruder to read the actual e-mail.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>POP, IMAP, HTTP Basic, Telnet authentication</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    Reads passwords off the wire in clear-text.
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>SMB, NFS, FTP traffic</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    Reads files of the wire.
