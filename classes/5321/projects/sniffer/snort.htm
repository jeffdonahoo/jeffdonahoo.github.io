<p align="left">Snort is a lightweight network intrusion detection system, capable of performing  real-time  traffic analysis and packet logging on IP networks.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">  It  can perform protocol analysis, content searching/matching and can be used to detect a variety of attacks and probes,  such as buffer overflows, stealth port scans, CGI attacks, SMB probes, OS fingerprinting attempts, and much  more.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">  Snort  uses a flexible rules language to describe traffic that it should collect or pass, as well as a detection engine  that  utilizes a modular plugin architecture.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">  Snort has a real-time alerting capability as well, incorporating alerting mechanisms for syslog, a user specified file, a UNIX socket, or WinPopup messages to Windows clients using Samba's
smbclient.</p>
<hr>
<p align="left">  
Snort has three primary uses.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">   It can be used as a straight packet sniffer like tcpdump(1),&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"> a packet logger (useful for network traffic debugging, etc),&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"> or as a full blown network intrusion detection system.<br>
<br>
Snort logs packets in either tcpdump(1) binary format  or in  Snort's decoded  ASCII  format to logging directories that are named based on the IP address of the "foreign" host&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Snort should work any place where libpcap is installed.</p>
