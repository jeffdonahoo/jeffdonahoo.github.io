<h1>Enrichment</h1>
<p/>
Computer Science (and technically oriented disciplines in general) tend to
generate rather clueless and mundane individuals with a greater appreciation
for the next patch of their operating system than the more significant things
in life. The idea behind memorizing poetry, quotes, speeches, and etc. is to
encourage you to look beyond your own contrived view of the world and see
things from another's perspective. If you wish to learn more about sonnets,

<h2>Because She Would Ask Me Why I Loved Her</h2>
Christopher Brennan<p/>

If questioning could make us wise<br/>
no eyes would ever gaze in eyes;<br/>
if all our tale were told in speech<br/>
no mouths would wander each to each.<br/>
<br/>
Were spirits free from mortal mesh<br/>
and love not bound in hearts of flesh<br/>
no aching breasts would yearn to meet<br/>
and find their ecstasy complete.<br/>
<br/>
For who is there that loves and knows<br/>
the secret powers by which he grows?<br/>
Were knowledge all, what were our need<br/>
to thrill and faint and sweetly bleed?<br/>
<br/>
Then seek not, sweet, the If and Why<br/>
I love you now until I die:<br/>
For I must love because I live<br/>
And life in me is what you give.<br/>

<h2>Touched by An Angel</h2>
Maya Angelou<p/>

We, unaccustomed to courage<br/>
exiles from delight<br/>
live coiled in shells of loneliness<br/>
until love leaves its high holy temple<br/>
and comes into our sight<br/>
to liberate us into life.<br/>
<br/>
Love arrives<br/>
and in its train come ecstasies<br/>
old memories of pleasure<br/>
ancient histories of pain.<br/>
Yet if we are bold,<br/>
love strikes away the chains of fear<br/>
from our souls.<br/>
<br/>
We are weaned from our timidity<br/>
In the flush of love's light<br/>
we dare be brave<br/>
And suddenly we see<br/>
that love costs all we are<br/>
and will ever be.<br/>
Yet it is only love<br/>
which sets us free.<br/>

<h2>Ozymandias</h2>
Percy Bysshe Shelley

<p/>I met a traveller from an antique
land <br/>
Who said: `Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br/>
Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand, <br/>
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown, <br/>
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, <br/>
Tell that its sculptor&nbsp; well those passions read <br/>
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br/>
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed. <br/>
And on the pedestal these words appear -- <br/>
&quot;My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: <br/>
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!&quot; <br/>
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <br/>
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare <br/>
The lone and level sands stretch far away.' </p>

<h2>Caged Bird</h2>
Maya Angelou<p/>

A free bird leaps <br/>
on the back of the wind   <br/>
and floats downstream   <br/>
till the current ends <br/>
and dips his wing <br/>
in the orange sun rays <br/>
and dares to claim the sky. <br/>
<br/>
But a bird that stalks <br/>
down his narrow cage <br/>
can seldom see through <br/>
his bars of rage <br/>
his wings are clipped and   <br/>
his feet are tied <br/>
so he opens his throat to sing. <br/>
<br/>
The caged bird sings   <br/>
with a fearful trill   <br/>
of things unknown   <br/>
but longed for still   <br/>
and his tune is heard   <br/>
on the distant hill   <br/>
for the caged bird   <br/>
sings of freedom. <br/>
<br/>
The free bird thinks of another breeze <br/>
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees <br/>
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn <br/>
and he names the sky his own <br/>
<br/>
But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams   <br/>
his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream   <br/>
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied   <br/>
so he opens his throat to sing. <br/>
<br/>
The caged bird sings   <br/>
with a fearful trill   <br/>
of things unknown   <br/>
but longed for still   <br/>
and his tune is heard   <br/>
on the distant hill   <br/>
for the caged bird   <br/>
sings of freedom.<br/>

<h2>Sonnet 18</h2>
William Shakespeare<p/>
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br/>
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br/>
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br/>
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:<br/>
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br/>
And often is his gold complexion dimmed,<br/>
And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br/>
By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:<br/>
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br/>
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,<br/>
Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,<br/>
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,<br/>
   So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br/>
   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

<h2>Sonnet 29</h2>
William Shakespeare

<p/>When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes<br/>
I all alone beweep my outcast state,<br/>
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,<br/>
And look upon myself, and curse my fate,<br/>
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,<br/>
Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,<br/>
Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,<br/>
With what I most enjoy contented least;<br/>
Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,<br/>
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,<br/>
Like to the lark at break of day arising<br/>
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;<br/>
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings<br/>
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.<o:p></p>

<h2>Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night</h2>
Dylan Thomas

<p/>Do not go gentle into that good
night,<br/>
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br/>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br/>
<br/>
Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br/>
Because their words had forked no lightning they<br/>
Do not go gentle into that good night.<br/>
<br/>
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br/>
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br/>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br/>
<br/>
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br/>
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br/>
Do not go gentle into that good night.<br/>
<br/>
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br/>
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br/>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br/>
<br/>
And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br/>
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br/>
Do not go gentle into that good night.<br/>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

<h2>Sonnet 116</h2>
William Shakespeare

<p/>Let me not to the marriage of true minds <br/>
Admit impediments. Love is not love <br/>
Which alters when it alteration finds, <br/>
Or bends with the remover to remove: <br/>
O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark, <br/>
That looks on tempests and is never shaken; <br/>
It is the star to every wandering bark, <br/>
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. <br/>
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks <br/>
Within his bending sickle's compass come; <br/>
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, <br/>
But bears it out even to the edge of doom. <br/>
If this be error, and upon me prov'd, <br/>
I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd. </p>

<h2>Sonnets from the Portuguese, XIV</h2>
Elizabeth Barrett Browning

<p/>If thou must love me, let it be for nought <br/>
Except for love's sake only. Do not say <br/>
'I love her for her smile--her look--her way <br/>
Of speaking gently,--for a trick of thought <br/>
That falls in well with mine, and certes brought <br/>
A sense of pleasant ease on such a day'-- <br/>
For these things in themselves, Beloved, may <br/>
Be changed, or change for thee,--and love, so wrought, <br/>
May be unwrought so. Neither love me for <br/>
Thine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry,-- <br/>
A creature might forget to weep, who bore <br/>
Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby! <br/>
But love me for love's sake, that evermore <br/>
Thou mayst love on, through love's eternity. </p>

<h2>The World Is Too Much With Us</h2>
William Wordsworth

<p/>The world is too much with us; late and soon, <br/>
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;— <br/>
Little we see in Nature that is ours; <br/>
We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon! <br/>
This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon; <br/>
The winds that will be howling at all hours, <br/>
And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers; <br/>
For this, for everything, we are out of tune; <br/>
It moves us not. Great God! I’d rather be <br/>
A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn; <br/>
So might I, standing on this pleasant lea, <br/>
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn; <br/>
Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea; <br/>
Or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn. <p/>

<h2>If</h2>
Rudyard Kipling

<p/>IF you can keep your head when all about you <br/>
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br/>
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br/>
But make allowance for their doubting too;<br/>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br/>
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,<br/>
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,<br/>
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:<br/>
<br/>
If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;<br/>
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;<br/>
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br/>
And treat those two impostors just the same;<br/>
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br/>
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br/>
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br/>
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools: <br/>
<br/>
If you can make one heap of all your winnings <br/>
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br/>
And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br/>
And never breathe a word about your loss;<br/>
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br/>
To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br/>
And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br/>
Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'<br/>
<br/>
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br/>
' Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,<br/>
if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br/>
If all men count with you, but none too much;<br/>
If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br/>
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,<br/>
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br/>
And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!</p>

<h2>The Chariot (Because I Could Not Stop for Death)</h2>
Emily Dickinson

<p/>Because I could not stop for Death,<br/>
He kindly stopped for me;<br/>
The carriage held but just ourselves<br/>
And Immortality. <br/>
<br/>
We slowly drove, he knew no haste,<br/>
And I had put away<br/>
My labor, and my leisure too,<br/>
For his civility. <br/>
<br/>
We passed the school where children played,<br/>
Their lessons scarcely done; <br/>
We passed the fields of gazing grain,<br/>
We passed the setting sun. <br/>
<br/>
We paused before a house that seemed<br/>
A swelling of the ground;<br/>
The roof was scarcely visible.<br/>
The cornice but a mound. <br/>
<br/>
Since then 'tis centuries; but each <br/>
Feels shorter than the day<br/>
I first surmised the horses' heads<br/>
Were toward eternity. </p>

<h2>The Last Leaf</h2>
Oliver Wendell Holmes

<p/>I saw him once before, <br/>
As he passed by the door,<br/>
And again<br/>
The pavement stones resound,<br/>
As he totters o'er the ground<br/>
With his cane.<br/>
<br/>
They say that in his prime,<br/>
Ere the pruning-knife of Time<br/>
Cut him down,<br/>
Not a better man was found<br/>
By the Crier on his round<br/>
Through the town.<br/>
<br/>
But now he walks the streets,<br/>
And looks at all he meets<br/>
Sad and wan,<br/>
And he shakes his feeble head,<br/>
That it seems as if he said,<br/>
&quot;They are gone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The mossy marbles rest<br/>
On the lips that he has prest<br/>
In their bloom,<br/>
And the names he loved to hear<br/>
Have been carved for many a year<br/>
On the tomb.<br/>
<br/>
My grandmamma has said <br/>
Poor old lady, she is dead<br/>
Long ago <br/>
That he had a Roman nose,<br/>
And his cheek was like a rose<br/>
In the snow;<br/>
<br/>
But now his nose is thin,<br/>
And it rests upon his chin<br/>
Like a staff,<br/>
And a crook is in his back,<br/>
And a melancholy crack<br/>
In his laugh.<br/>
<br/>
I know it is a sin<br/>
For me to sit and grin<br/>
At him here;<br/>
But the old three-cornered hat,<br/>
And the breeches, and all that,<br/>
Are so queer!<br/>
<br/>
And if I should live to be<br/>
The last leaf upon the tree<br/>
In the spring,<br/>
Let them smile, as I do now,<br/>
At the old forsaken bough<br/>
Where I cling.</p>
