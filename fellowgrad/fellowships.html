<FONT COLOR="#000000">There are many opportunities to receive monetary
sponsorship for higher education, and, quite possibly, it is much easier
than you think to successfully apply for such opportunities.&nbsp; Fellowships
are awarded to both students seeking <B>both </B>undergraduate and graduate
degrees.&nbsp; Baylor University <B>actively</B> encourages its students
to seek national and international fellowships.&nbsp; To learn more about
the university's efforts at supporting fellowship applications, see their
web page on <A HREF="http://www.baylor.edu/scholarships/links.htm">National
and International Scholarships</A>.&nbsp; Note that in some instances Baylor
actually gives students money just for applying for fellowships, regardless
of success.&nbsp; Many universities have fellowships for their students
(e.g. <A HREF="http://www.utexas.edu/ogs/otherfellowships/index.html">University
of Texas</A>) so if you have a program in mind at a particular university,
inquire directly with the university concerning fellowship opportunities.&nbsp;
