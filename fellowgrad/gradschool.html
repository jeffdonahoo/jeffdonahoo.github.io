<FONT COLOR="#000000">We encourage students to consider continuing their
education after receiving their degree in Computer Science from Baylor
University.&nbsp; Many students have gone on to Master's and Doctoral degrees
after receiving their Bachelor's from Baylor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT> Below
are some common questions concerning graduate school, along with possible
sources for answers.
<H2>
<FONT COLOR="#3333FF">How do I find out about graduate programs?</FONT></H2>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">If you decide to seek a master's degree in Computer
Science, we encourage you to consider Baylor's </FONT><A HREF="http://cs.baylor.edu/csi/Grad.htm">graduate
program in Computer Science</A>.&nbsp; Of course, there are many opportunities
at other <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Regional/Countries/United_States/Education/Colleges_and_Universities/Complete_Listing/">schools</A>.&nbsp;
Simply find the universities you are interested in attending on the web.&nbsp;
Often they will provide instructions on what graduate programs they have
and how to apply.
<H2>
<FONT COLOR="#3333FF">How can I afford graduate school?</FONT></H2>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">Often students seeking a graduate degree in Computer
Science can get funding from the university for performing tasks such as
research and teaching assistance.  The ACM publishes the 
<A HREF="http://www.acm.org/gad/">Graduate Assistantship Directory</A> which 
lists assistantship opportunities at <b>some</b> graduate programs.  Fellowship
programs have also been established to fund students seeking graduate degrees.&nbsp;
Some fellowships pay student tuition as well as a yearly salary.&nbsp;
Often the only requirement for receiving a fellowship is agreeing to go
to graduate school so fellowships are a great opportunity. Baylor's Computer
Science department actively encourages students to seek out fellowships.&nbsp;
We maintain a <A HREF="fellowships.html">webpage</A> listing advertised
opportunities for fellowships.&nbsp; Many graduate schools offer university
fellowships to their own students so make sure you check with the specific
universities in which you are interested for fellowship opportunities.
(See examples from the <A HREF="http://www.utexas.edu/ogs/otherfellowships/index.html">University
of Texas</A> and <A HREF="http://www.gatech.edu/grad/studies/fellowship.html">Georgia
Tech</A>.)</FONT>
<H2>
<FONT COLOR="#3333FF">What do I need to do to go to graduate school?</FONT></H2>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">
<DL>
<DT> Application</DT> <DD>  Application deadlines can be as early as
January so start working on your applications early. </DD>
<DT>Graduate Records Examination (GRE)</DT><DD>Most schools require the 
General GRE Test, and many Ph.D. programs also require the Computer Science
Subject Test.  Take these tests early in case you want to retake them.  The
general can be taken as a paper or computerized test; however, the subject test
is only paper-based.  Try the <A HREF="http://www.gre.org"> GRE web site</A> 
for additional information.</DD>
<DT> Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)</DT><DD>Many schools require 
foreign students to take the TOEFL exam to demonstrate proficiency in the
English language.  Try the <A HREF="http://www.toefl.org/index.html"> TOEFL
web site</A> for additional information.</DD>
<DT> Letters of Recommendation</DT><DD>Many programs require letters of
recommendation.  Start on this early to insure enough time for your
recommendations to be written.</DD>
<DT> Purpose Statement</DT><DD>Many programs, especially doctoral, require 
the applicant to write a statement of purpose definining what they hope
to accomplish in and after graduate school.  This letter can be very 
important to the admission committee so take plenty of time in writing it and
have it reviewed before submission.</DD>

<FONT COLOR="#3333FF">May I "test drive" some graduate school courses during
my time as an undergraduate?</FONT></H2>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">
Baylor computer science undergraduates wishing to "test drive" graduate 
school may take up to two graduate computer science courses in the last 
semester of their senior year.  These courses cannot count towards an
undergraduate degree; however, you may be able to transfer them to another 
graduate program.  Please talk to Dr. Greg Speegle (<A HREF="mailto:speegle@cs.baylor.edu">email</A>) about this option.
