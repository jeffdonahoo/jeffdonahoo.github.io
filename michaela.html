Hello!  My name is Michaela Ashley Donahoo.  I was born on November
23, 1995 in Atlanta, Georgia at Northside Hospital.  At birth, I
weighted 6lbs 7ozs, and I was 19.5 inches long.

<P>

Speaking of my birthday, here are pictures of me with my <A
HREF="mjd.html"> father </A> shortly after delivery.  I hate this hat.
Don't you?

My pad is pretty cool:

My parents have hired a highly recommended and competent babysitter to
care for me:

I have also created <A HREF="images/michaela.mpeg"> MPEG Video </A> of
me playing with my folks.  Aren't they cute?

<P>

Here is a print of my feet at birth.  I am not exactly sure why they
took them.  I think nurses are entertained by putting ink all over
infants.  Weird!

Well I have aged and matured considerably since the pictures above
were taken.  It amazes me that I was ever that young and naive.  Here
are some more recent pictures of me at about 4 months old:

Many, many years have gone past.  Now I look like this:
