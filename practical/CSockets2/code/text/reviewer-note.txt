Thanks for reviewing our manuscript.

Please be warned that this version is still very drafty in places. In
particular:

0. The API section is not included.  We will probably include a
   stripped-down version, since most people have online access to man
   pages.  The idea is to include only the "value added" information
   that is not in the man pages.

1. Chapter 6 "Socket Programming" has not been updated at all.  We
   plan to modify at least some of the code to handle IPv6, but
   presently it contains many unresolved references.

2. Line numbers are off in all the code commentaries.  Hope you can
   ignore this.

3. The code has not been extensively tested.  In particular it has not
   been tested on many platforms.  If you see obvious problems,
   obviously we'd like to hear about them.  (If you want the code, let
   us know and we'll send you a tarball.)

4. There are lots of formatting issues, but hopefully you can see
   through that and get the meaning.

We have extensively revised Chapters 1-5, and are especially
interested in your comments on the new organization and presentation
order.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

Again, we are grateful for your help!
