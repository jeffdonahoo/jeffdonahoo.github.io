<H1>Alternate Persona Disclaimer</H1>

Trevor Adam Donahoo is an alternate
persona created by the original me <A
HREF="http://cs.baylor.edu/~donahoo">Jeff
Donahoo</A>.  I began development of Trevor in 1997.  This is a
serious effort to evolve a new, independent
side of myself to explore the unexercised/unarticulated aspect of my
psyche.  We all have "others" within us that manifest themselves as
indecision.  For example, one may convincingly articulate the argument
that, in war with an evil dictator, civilian casualties are the
unfortunate, but necessary, effects of war; however any sane person is
significantly troubled by the mangled bodies of children killed in
that war.  
<P>
An alternate persona can allow one to pick an entirely
different attitude towards war, claiming that all lives are too
precious to destroy and life under tyranny is better than life with
blood on one's hands.  While it's true that a single person can
grapple with these issues, an alternate persona allows one to "let go"
and vehemently defend points of view their original persona would
dismiss as too radical.  I plan to <b>slowly</b> develop one of these
competing views into an entirely different person.  I hope to use this
technique to explore the previously unexplored and harvest creativity
not accessible to my original persona.  I do not plan to instantly
transform myself into my alter-self because that would be designing
rather than developing a new person;
instead I plan to slowly evolve Trev by observing, through interactions
with my friends, what really defines a person.  I am interested in the
ideas, gestures, colloquialistic phrases, etc that make a person
unique.
<P>
Note that Trev is not intended to be an antithesis of the original
me.  In fact, Trev and Jeff share the same set of core values.
Imagine them to be identical twins raised together, but each
developing their own unique view of the world.
