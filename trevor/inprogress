Why Survive?

Hard driven motions repeatedly made
No purpose or thought of what's to be saved
Laboring hard to drink from the grail
So very indifferent when all efforts fail


WHy?

Stupidity
Ignornace
Selfishness?
Gift?

Death:
http://www.borrowed-tyme.com/poem.html

Pillow of stone

My life is light, waiting for the death wind, 
Like a feather on the back of my hand.
- - T. S. Eliot

Because I could not stop for Death -
He kindly stopped for me -
The carriage held just Ourselves -
And Immortality. 
- - Emily Dickinson "Poem 712" 

Better to die, and sleep
The never-waking sleep, than linger on
And dare to live when the soul's life is gone. 
- - Sophocles "Ajax" (circa 409 B.C.)

Come to the bridal chamber, Death! 
Come to the mother's, when she feels 
For the first time her first-born's breath! 
Come when the blessed seals 
That close the pestilence are broke, 
And crowded cities wail its stroke! 
Come in consumption's ghastly form, 
The earthquake shock, the ocean storm! 
Come when the heart beats high and warm, 
With banquet song, and dance, and wine! 
And thou art terrible!--the tear, 
The groan, the knell, the pall, the bier, 
And all we know or dream or fear 
Of agony are thine.
- - Fitz-Greene Halleck "Marco Bozzaris"

 Come! let the burial rite be read-the funeral song be sung!- 
An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young- 
A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young. 
- - Edgar Allan Poe "Lenore"  

Do not go gentle into that good night, 
Old age should burn and rave at close of day; 
Rage, rage against the dying of the light. 
- - Dylan Thomas "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night" 

In any man who dies there dies with him,
his first snow and kiss and fight...
Not people die but worlds die in them.
- - Yevgeny Yevtushenko

There is a reaper whose name is Death, 
And with his sickle keen
He reaps the bearded grain at a breath, 
And the flowers that grow between. 
- - Henry W. Longfellow "The Reaper and the Flowers" 

Unable are the Loved to die 
For Love is Immortality. 
- - Emily Dickinson 

 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?
   ~ ~ Bible - 1 Corinthians 55 

To every thing there is a season,
and a time to every purpose under the heaven;
A time to be born, and a time to die;
a time to plant, and a time to pluck that which is planted.
   ~ ~ Bible - Ecclesiastes 3:1

Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. 
   ~ ~ Bible - Genesis 3:19
