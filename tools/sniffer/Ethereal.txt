Ethereal is a free network protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows. It allows you to examine data from a live network or from a capture file on disk. You can interactively browse the capture data, viewing summary and detail information for each packet. Ethereal has several powerful features, including a rich display filter language and the ability to view the reconstructed stream of a TCP session.


1.

This image shows Ethereal in the middle of a capture. As you can see, you can inspect the captured data in great detail, all while the capture is still in progress

2.This shows a DNS lookup from the server's perspective. It's interesting to note that the server issued four queries to resolve the name, and the client re-sent its query before the server could respond. 

3.
The "Follow TCP Stream" item under the "Tools" menu allows you to inspect the ASCII contents of a TCP data stream in a separate window. This can be invaluable for tracking down HTTP, SMTP, and POP server problems


What protocols/media are currently supported?

A: Ethereal can read live data from ethernet, token ring, and serial (PPP and SLIP) connections. It can also read a variety of capture file formats, including libpcap/tcpdump, snoop (including Shomiti), LanAlyzer, Sniffer (compressed and uncompressed), MS Network Monitor, AIX iptrace, NetXray, Sniffer Pro, RADCOM, Lucent/Ascend debug output, output from Toshiba's ISDN router, HPUX nettl, and the ISDN4BSD "i4btrace" utility.

Below is a list of supported protocols and media. A complete list can be found in the ethereal(1) man page.
