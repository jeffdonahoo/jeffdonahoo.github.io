<p><br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-Serif">We encountered several difficulties
in our quest to successfully compile a kernel. We supply you with the obstacles
we faced (so <b>you don't have to re-invent the wheel</b>).</font></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-Serif">Make sure the correct time and
date are set on your computer. Otherwise, you will get a lot of warnings.
You set the date with the command:</font></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-Serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"><i>></i> <i>date MMDDhhmmYY</i></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-Serif">Everytime we rebooted, the clock
was reset to the value of the hardware clock. Set the hardware clock to
the current system time with the command:&nbsp;</font></li>

<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-Serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">> hwclock --systohc</font></b></i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-Serif">Our first installation of the RedHat
Linux Operating System was version 7.0. We could not get any version of
the kernel source code to compile because of changes made to the gcc programs
and libraries. Instead of trying to change the version of gcc, we decided
to work with RedHat Linux 6.2.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,Sans-Serif">The first time we installed version
6.2, we did not install many packages; therefore, we were missing the <i>gcc
and g++</i> compilers, the kernel-headers&nbsp; along with other files.
The <a href="kernel_errors.html">error messages</a> we were getting were
for undefined symbols. We knew we were missing files that defined the symbol(s)
but we did not know which files nor did we know in which rmps they resided.
Consequently, we reinstalled version 6.2 including the <b><i>Kernel Development</i></b>
and <b><i>Development</i></b>packages. These packages had all the files
that we were missing previously.&nbsp;</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helevetica,Sans-Serif">Since Schemp is a uniprocessor
computer, we had to turn "<b>Symmetric Multiprocessing</b>" off.&nbsp;
You will find this in&nbsp; <i><b>Processor Type and Features</b> </i>menu
when you configure.</font>
