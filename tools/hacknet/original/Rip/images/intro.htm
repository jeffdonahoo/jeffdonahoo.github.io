<H2>The DARPA Internet Architecture. </H2>





<P><IMG SRC="images/greenbal.gif" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14> Internet Protocols


</P>





<P>The Internet system consists of a number of interconnected <A HREF="diction.htm#packet">packet</A>


networks supporting communication among <A HREF="diction.htm#host">host</A>


computers using the Internet protocols. These protocols include the Internet


Protocol (IP), the Internet Control Message Protocol (<A HREF="diction.htm#ICMp">ICMP</A>),


the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and application protocols depending


upon them . </P>





<P>All Internet protocols use IP as the basic data transport mechanism.


IP is a <A HREF="diction.htm#datagram">datagram</A>, or connectionless,


internetwork service and includes provision for addressing, type-of-service


specification, fragmentation and reassembly, and security information.


<A HREF="diction.htm#ICMp">ICMP</A> is considered an integral part of


IP, although it is architecturally layered upon IP. <A HREF="diction.htm#ICMp">ICMP</A>


provides error reporting, flow control and first-hop <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A>


redirection. </P>





<P>Reliable data delivery is provided in the Internet protocol suite by


transport-level protocols such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP),


which provides end-end retransmission, resequencing and connection control.


Transport-level connectionless service is provided by the User <A HREF="diction.htm#datagram">datagram</A>


Protocol (<A HREF="diction.htm#udp">UDP</A>). </P>





<P><IMG SRC="images/greenbal.gif" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14> Networks and <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A>s


</P>





<P>Constituent networks may generally be divided into two classes. </P>





<OL>


<LI>Local-Area Networks (<A HREF="/networks/1994/networks/mz_lan.html">LAN</A>s)


</LI>





<LI>Wide-Area Networks (<A HREF="/networks/1994/networks/wan.html">WAN</A>s)


</LI>


</OL>





<P>In the Internet model, constituent networks are connected together by


IP <A HREF="diction.htm#datagram">datagram</A> forwarders which are called


&quot;<A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A>s&quot; or &quot;IP <A HREF="diction.htm#router">router</A>s&quot;.


</P>





<P>A <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A> is connected to two or more


networks, appearing to each of these networks as a connected <A HREF="diction.htm#host">host</A>.


Thus, it has a physical interface and an IP address on each of the connected


networks. Forwarding an IP <A HREF="diction.htm#datagram">datagram</A>


generally requires the <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A> to choose


the address of the next-hop <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A> or


(for the final hop) the destination <A HREF="diction.htm#host">host</A>.


This choice, called &quot;routing&quot;, depends upon a routing data-base


within the <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A>. This routing data-base


should be maintained dynamically to reflect the current topology of the


Internet system; a <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A> normally accomplishes


this by participating in distributed routing and reachability algorithms


with other <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A>s. <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A>s


provide <A HREF="diction.htm#datagram">datagram</A> transport only, and


they seek to minimize the state information necessary to sustain this service


in the interest of routing flexibility and robustness. </P>





<P><A NAME="as"></A><IMG SRC="images/greenbal.gif" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14>


Autonomous Systems </P>





<P>For technical, managerial, and sometimes political reasons, the <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A>s


of the Internet system are grouped into collections called &quot;autonomous


systems&quot; . The <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A>s included in


a single autonomous system (AS) are expected to </P>





<UL>


<LI>Be under the control of a single operations and maintenance (O&amp;M)


organization; </LI>





<LI>Employ common routing protocols among themselves, to maintain their


routing data-bases dynamically. </LI>


</UL>





<P>A number of different dynamic routing protocols have been developed;


the particular choice of routing protocol within a single autonomous system


is generically called an interior <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A>


protocol or <A HREF="diction.htm#igp">IGP</A>. </P>





<P>An IP <A HREF="diction.htm#datagram">datagram</A> may have to traverse


the <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A>s of two or more autonomous


systems to reach its destination, and the autonomous systems must provide


each other with topology information to allow such forwarding. The Border


Gateway Protocol (<A HREF="diction.htm#bgp">BGP</A>) is used for this


purpose, between <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A>s of different


autonomous systems. </P>





<P><IMG SRC="images/greenbal.gif" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=14> Routing Information


Protocol (RIP) </P>





<P>RIP is one protocol in a series of routing protocols based on the Bellman-Ford


(or distance vector) algorithm. This algorithm has been used for routing


computations in computer networks since the early days of the ARPANET.


The particular <A HREF="diction.htm#packet">packet</A> formats and protocol


described here are based on the program &quot;routed&quot;, which is included


with the Berkeley distribution of Unix. It has become a de facto standard


for exchange of routing information among <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A>s


and <A HREF="diction.htm#host">host</A>s. It is implemented for this purpose


by most commercial vendors of IP <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A>s.


Note, however, that many of these vendors have their own protocols which


are used among their own <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A>s. </P>





<P>This protocol is most useful as an &quot;interior <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A>


protocol&quot;. In a nationwide network such as the current Internet, it


is very unlikely that a single routing protocol will used for the whole


network. Rather, the network will be organized as a collection of &quot;autonomous


systems&quot;. An autonomous system will in general be administered by


a single entity, or at least will have some reasonable degree of technical


and administrative control. Each autonomous system will have its own routing


technology. This may well be different for different autonomous systems.


The routing protocol used within an autonomous system is referred to as


an interior <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A> protocol, or &quot;<A HREF="diction.htm#igp">IGP</A>&quot;.


A separate protocol is used to interface among the autonomous systems.


The earliest such protocol, still used in the Internet, is &quot;<A HREF="diction.htm#egp">EGP</A>&quot;


(exterior <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A> protocol). Such protocols


are now usually referred to as inter-AS routing protocols. RIP was designed


to work with moderate-size networks using reasonably homogeneous technology.


Thus it is suitable as an <A HREF="diction.htm#igp">IGP</A> for many campuses


and for regional networks using serial lines whose speeds do not vary widely.


</P>





<P>RIP is intended for use within the IP-based Internet. The Internet is


organized into a number of networks connected by <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A>s.


The networks may be either point-to-point links or more complex networks


such as Ethernet or the ARPANET. <A HREF="diction.htm#host">host</A>s


and <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A>s are presented with IP <A HREF="diction.htm#datagram">datagram</A>s


addressed to some <A HREF="diction.htm#host">host</A>. Routing is the


method by which the <A HREF="diction.htm#host">host</A> or <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A>


decides where to send the <A HREF="diction.htm#datagram">datagram</A>.


It may be able to send the <A HREF="diction.htm#datagram">datagram</A>


directly to the destination, if that destination is on one of the networks


that are directly connected to the <A HREF="diction.htm#host">host</A>


or <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A>. However, the interesting case


is when the destination is not directly reachable. In this case, the <A HREF="diction.htm#host">host</A>


or <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway </A>attempts to send the <A HREF="diction.htm#datagram">datagram</A>


to a <A HREF="diction.htm#gate">gateway</A> that is nearer the destination.


The goal of a routing protocol is very simple. It is to supply the information


that is needed to do routing. </P>





<P>This protocol does not solve every possible routing problem. As mentioned


above, it is primary intended for use as an <A HREF="diction.htm#igp">IGP</A>,


in reasonably homogeneous networks of moderate size. In addition, the following


specific limitations should be mentioned </P>





<UL>


<LI>The protocol is limited to networks whose longest path involves 15


hops. Note that this statement of the limit assumes that a cost of 1 is


used for each network. </LI>





<LI>The protocol depends upon &quot;counting to infinity&quot; to resolve


certain unusual situations. </LI>





<LI>This protocol uses fixed &quot;metrics&quot; to compare alternative


routes. </LI>


</UL>
