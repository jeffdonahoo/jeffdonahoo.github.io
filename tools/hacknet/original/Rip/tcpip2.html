<p><a NAME="doc1"></a><b>General IP Addressing Architecture</b>
<br>IP addresses consist of a 32-bit value.
<br>Usually, for convenience, it is presented in DECIMAL DOT NOTATION:
<br>4 octets (bytes) separated by a dot.
<br>Each physical network has its own unique network address.
<br>Each host has its own unique address.
<br>Routers or gateways have one or more addresses
<br>(depended on the of links they have)
<p>An IP address is therefore built of a network and a host
<br>identifications.
<br>
<hr>
<p><a NAME="doc2"></a><b>Forms of IP Addresses</b>
<br>There are five forms of IP addresses:
<p>Class A :126 networks, each can have up to (16M-2) nodes.
<br>(1.0.0.0 - 126.0.0.0)
<p>Class B: (16K-2) networks, each can have up to (64K-2) nodes
<br>(127.0.0.0 - 191.255.0.0)
<p>Class C: (2M-2) networks, each can have up to 254 nodes.
<br>(192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.0)
<p>Class D: a multicast address.
<br>(224.0.0.0 - 240.0.0.0)
<p>Class E: reserved for future use.
<br>(241.0.0.0 - 248.0.0.0)
<br>&nbsp;

<p>For example:
<br>The address (binary) - 10000000 00000111 00001111 00000001
<br>has the DECIMAL DOT NOTATION: 128.7.15.1
<br>It belongs to Class B addresses.
<br>Its Network-id is: 128.7
<br>Its Host-id is: 15.1
<br>
<hr>
<p><a NAME="doc3"></a><b>Special forms of INTERNET Addresses</b>
<br>0.0.0.0 - This host.
<p>0.host_number - host on this net.
<p>255.255.255.255 - Limited broadcast (local net).
<p>net_number.255 - Directed broadcast for the specified net.
<p>127.anything - Loopback (should never appear on the net).

<p><a NAME="doc5"></a><b>IP Subnetting</b>
<br>Subnetting is a Technique used to allow a single IP network
<br>address to span multiple physical networks.
<br>IP hosts should support subnetting.
<br>Subnetting is done by using some of the bits of the host-id part
<br>of the IP address as a physical network identifier.
<br>The subnet mask is used to determine the bits of the network
<br>identifier.
<br>All hosts on the same network should have the same subnet mask.
<p>An example of Subnetting:
<p>The Class B network 128.10.0.0 can be subnetted using the first
<br>8 bits of the host-id, to span 254 different physical networks.
<br>The subnet mask for this case is 255.255.255.0
<br>The subnetworks are: 128.10.1.0, 128.10.2.0, ..., 128.10.254.0 .
<br>Each of the subnetworks can have up to 254 different hosts:
<br>128.10.XXX.1, 128.10.XXX.2, ..., 128.10.XXX.254 .
<br>If there is a need for less physical nets and more hosts in each
<br>one, less host-id bits can be used for subnetting. For example:
<br>With the subnet mask 255.255.254.0, 126 different subnets are
<br>available with up to 510 hosts in each one.
<p>Many Class A and B networks do not contain as many hosts as
<br>they could. This situation causes a lot of address space waste.
<br>Subnetting better utilizes the address space by dividing these
<br>big networks to smaller ones.

<br>&nbsp;
<p>All Gateways except G (Which is physically interconnected between
<br>the networks) route as if there was a single physical network.
<p>
<hr>
<p><a NAME="doc7"></a><b>IP - The Next Generation (IPng - IPv6)</b>
<br>The growing number of INTERNET hosts causes a shortage in IP
<br>addresses and will eventually consume the entire address space.
<br>The theoretical address space size (2^32 nodes) is largely wasted
<br>due to assignment inefficiencies.
<br>Dividing the address space into classes (A, B and C) had its own
<br>contribution to the inefficiency of addresses assignment.
<br>Changing the IP addressing scheme is a matter concerning all
<br>INTERNET users and is an opportunity for providing additional
<br>functionality to the IP.
<br>The new version of IP is often referred to as IPng:
<br>"INTERNET Protocol: The Next Generation".
<br>Most INTERNET users agreed IPng should have a hierarchical
<br>address structure. This new address structure should be large
<br>enough to meet the needs of the INTERNET community for a very
<br>long time.
<p>There were several proposals for IPng. The most likely to become
<br>a standard were: "Common Architecture for the INTERNET" (CATNIP)
<br>"Simple INTERNET Protocol Plus" (SIPP), and "The TCP/UDP Over
<br>CLNP-Addressed Networks (TUBA) proposals.
<p>The guidelines for choosing one proposals over the others were:
<p>* Current address assignment policies should not be changed.
<br>* There is no need to reclaim assigned network numbers.
<br>* There is no need to renumber most of the INTERNET
<p>Eventually the "Simple INTERNET Protocol Plus (SIPP) Spec.
<br>(128 bit ver)" was adopted as the basis for IPng.
<p>IPng was assigned the name IPv6.
<p>
<hr>
<p><a NAME="doc8"></a><b>IPng - IPv6 addressing</b>
<br>IPng offers a larger address space for the INTERNET users.
<br>The IP address size will be increased from 32 bits to 128 bits.
<br>This change will allow a much bigger number of nodes than is
<br>available today, with more levels of addressing hierarchy,
<br>and simpler auto-configuration of addresses.
<p>An address size of 128 bits is large enough to support a huge
<br>number of nodes even with the inefficiency of address assignment.
<p>The IP header will be changed. Some fields will be removed
<br>in order to keep the overhead low (in spite of increasing the
<br>number of address bits). Thus, even though the IPv6 addresses are
<br>four times longer than the IPv4 addresses, the IPv6 header is
<br>only twice the size of the IPv4 header.
<p>IPv6 will have a new type of address: "Cluster address", which
<br>will identify topological regions.
<br>A new function in IPv6 is source routing, which together with
<br>Cluster addresses will allow nodes to control their routing in
<br>a more precise way.
<p>
<hr>
<p><a NAME="doc9"></a><b>Upgrading IPv4 to IPng - IPv6</b>
<br>The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 will be simple and flexible.
<p>The upgrade will be Incremental: Existing IPv4 hosts and Routers
<br>may be upgraded to IPv6 and new hosts and Routers can be
<br>installed independently.
<br>When existing IPv4 hosts or Routers are upgraded, they can
<br>continue to use their current address.
<br>The start-up costs are low and little work is needed to upgrade
<br>existing systems to IPv6.
