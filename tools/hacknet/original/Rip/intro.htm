The DARPA Internet Architecture.</h2>
<img SRC="greenbal.gif" height=14 width=14> Internet Protocols
<p>The Internet system consists of a number of interconnected <a href="diction.htm#packet">packet</a>
networks supporting communication among <a href="diction.htm#host">host</a>
computers using the Internet protocols. These protocols include the Internet
Protocol (IP), the Internet Control Message Protocol (<a href="diction.htm#ICMp">ICMP</a>),
the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and application protocols depending
upon them .
<p>All Internet protocols use IP as the basic data transport mechanism.
IP is a <a href="diction.htm#datagram">datagram</a>, or connectionless,
internetwork service and includes provision for addressing, type-of-service
specification, fragmentation and reassembly, and security information.
<a href="diction.htm#ICMp">ICMP</a>
is considered an integral part of IP, although it is architecturally layered
upon IP. <a href="diction.htm#ICMp">ICMP</a> provides error reporting,
flow control and first-hop <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a> redirection.
<p>Reliable data delivery is provided in the Internet protocol suite by
transport-level protocols such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP),
which provides end-end retransmission, resequencing and connection control.
Transport-level connectionless service is provided by the User <a href="diction.htm#datagram">datagram</a>
Protocol (<a href="diction.htm#udp">UDP</a>).
<p><img SRC="greenbal.gif" height=14 width=14> Networks and <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>s
<p>Constituent networks may generally be divided into two classes.
<ol>
<li>
Local-Area Networks (<a href="diction.htm#lan">LAN</a>s)</li>

<li>
Wide-Area Networks (<a href="diction.htm#wan">WAN</a>s)</li>
</ol>
In the Internet model, constituent networks are connected together by IP
<a href="diction.htm#datagram">datagram</a>
forwarders which are called "<a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>s" or
"IP <a href="diction.htm#router">router</a>s".
<p>A <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a> is connected to two or more
networks, appearing to each of these networks as a connected <a href="diction.htm#host">host</a>.
Thus, it has a physical interface and an IP address on each of the connected
networks. Forwarding an IP <a href="diction.htm#datagram">datagram</a>
generally requires the <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a> to choose
the address of the next-hop <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a> or (for
the final hop) the destination <a href="diction.htm#host">host</a>. This
choice, called "routing", depends upon a routing data-base within the <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>.
This routing data-base should be maintained dynamically to reflect the
current topology of the Internet system; a <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>
normally accomplishes this by participating in distributed routing and
reachability algorithms with other <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>s.
<a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>s
provide <a href="diction.htm#datagram">datagram</a> transport only, and
they seek to minimize the state information necessary to sustain this service
in the interest of routing flexibility and robustness.
<p><a NAME="as"></a><img SRC="greenbal.gif" height=14 width=14> Autonomous
Systems
<p>For technical, managerial, and sometimes political reasons, the <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>s
of the Internet system are grouped into collections called "autonomous
systems" . The <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>s included in a single
autonomous system (AS) are expected to
<ul>
<li>
Be under the control of a single operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) organization;</li>

<li>
Employ common routing protocols among themselves, to maintain their routing
data-bases dynamically.</li>
</ul>
A number of different dynamic routing protocols have been developed; the
particular choice of routing protocol within a single autonomous system
is generically called an interior <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>
protocol or <a href="diction.htm#igp">IGP</a>.
<p>An IP <a href="diction.htm#datagram">datagram</a> may have to traverse
the <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>s of two or more autonomous systems
to reach its destination, and the autonomous systems must provide each
other with topology information to allow such forwarding. The Border Gateway
Protocol (<a href="diction.htm#bgp">BGP</a>) is used for this purpose,
between <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>s of different autonomous
systems.
<p><img SRC="greenbal.gif" height=14 width=14> Routing Information Protocol
(RIP)
<p>RIP is one protocol in a series of routing protocols based on the Bellman-Ford
(or distance vector) algorithm. This algorithm has been used for routing
computations in computer networks since the early days of the ARPANET.
The particular <a href="diction.htm#packet">packet</a> formats and protocol
described here are based on the program "routed", which is included with
the Berkeley distribution of Unix. It has become a de facto standard for
exchange of routing information among <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>s
and <a href="diction.htm#host">host</a>s. It is implemented for this purpose
by most commercial vendors of IP <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>s.
Note, however, that many of these vendors have their own protocols which
are used among their own <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>s.
<p>This protocol is most useful as an "interior <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>
protocol". In a nationwide network such as the current Internet, it is
very unlikely that a single routing protocol will used for the whole network.
Rather, the network will be organized as a collection of "autonomous systems".
An autonomous system will in general be administered by a single entity,
or at least will have some reasonable degree of technical and administrative
control. Each autonomous system will have its own routing technology. This
may well be different for different autonomous systems. The routing protocol
used within an autonomous system is referred to as an interior <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>
protocol, or "<a href="diction.htm#igp">IGP</a>". A separate protocol is
used to interface among the autonomous systems. The earliest such protocol,
still used in the Internet, is "<a href="diction.htm#egp">EGP</a>" (exterior
<a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>
protocol). Such protocols are now usually referred to as inter-AS routing
protocols. RIP was designed to work with moderate-size networks using reasonably
homogeneous technology. Thus it is suitable as an <a href="diction.htm#igp">IGP</a>
for many campuses and for regional networks using serial lines whose speeds
do not vary widely.
<p>RIP is intended for use within the IP-based Internet. The Internet is
organized into a number of networks connected by <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>s.
The networks may be either point-to-point links or more complex networks
such as Ethernet or the ARPANET. <a href="diction.htm#host">host</a>s and
<a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>s
are presented with IP <a href="diction.htm#datagram">datagram</a>s addressed
to some <a href="diction.htm#host">host</a>. Routing is the method by which
the <a href="diction.htm#host">host</a> or <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>
decides where to send the <a href="diction.htm#datagram">datagram</a>.
It may be able to send the <a href="diction.htm#datagram">datagram</a>
directly to the destination, if that destination is on one of the networks
that are directly connected to the <a href="diction.htm#host">host</a>
or <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a>. However, the interesting case
is when the destination is not directly reachable. In this case, the <a href="diction.htm#host">host</a>
or <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway </a>attempts to send the <a href="diction.htm#datagram">datagram</a>
to a <a href="diction.htm#gate">gateway</a> that is nearer the destination.
The goal of a routing protocol is very simple. It is to supply the information
that is needed to do routing.
<p>This protocol does not solve every possible routing problem. As mentioned
above, it is primary intended for use as an <a href="diction.htm#igp">IGP</a>,
in reasonably homogeneous networks of moderate size. In addition, the following
specific limitations should be mentioned
<ul>
<li>
The protocol is limited to networks whose longest path involves 15 hops.
Note that this statement of the limit assumes that a cost of 1 is used
for each network.</li>

<li>
The protocol depends upon "counting to infinity" to resolve certain unusual
situations.</li>

<li>
This protocol uses fixed "metrics" to compare alternative routes.</li>
</ul>
