<p align="center"><b><font size="5">Our Definition of&nbsp; &quot;Secure&quot;</font></b></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An important thing to realize is what it
means to be &quot;secure.&quot;&nbsp; This is not meant to be a course in
security, but a few things do need to be explained and understood.&nbsp; These
are outlined below.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, and foremost, nothing is absolutely
secure.&nbsp; Absolutely secure would mean that no one would have access to it
in any shape or form (and that doesn't sound very useful to me.)&nbsp; Security
deals with everything from people not handing out their passwords like it was
candy on Halloween to people having physical access to the computer to hackers
trying to infiltrate (or bring down) a foreign system.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of this, we limit our definition of
security to just the ability of hackers to view the login names and their
associated passwords.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, in programs such as <b>telnet</b> (and
even worse, <b>ftp</b>), we say that these are very insecure since they allow
anyone to sniff the IP packets and determine the information based on a
clear-cut formula.&nbsp; Which means that even if you had two
&quot;totally&quot; secure machines, they couldn't talk to each other over the
network without others able to listen in easily to the packets.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus Secure Shell was made, so that two
&quot;totally&quot; secure machines could relatively be secure even when talking
to each other.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These &quot;totally&quot; secure machines
don't really exist, but the Secure Shell does not bother with the endpoint's
security.&nbsp; It's main purpose to make connections BETWEEN machines
secure.&nbsp; It should be noted that even when we say &quot;secure&quot; here,
it is still not absolutely secure, but due to the way encryption algorithms
work, it is highly doubtful that anyone could crack the code in a timely manner
(for more detailed understanding of how encryption works, one would need to
understand complexity classes.&nbsp; See here for the theory, and here for more
information on encryption.)</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, we will define &quot;secure&quot;,
with regards to network communication, as the lack of ease that hackers or other
malcontents could listen in to IP packets going over the network and understand
the actual information within the packets.</p>
