<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>DEMONSTRATION OF UNWISE USE OF SSH</b></font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If my machine was running the secure shell
daemon as well as the machine I wanted to connect to, I could connect securely
from my machine to the host machine.&nbsp; However, this is not assured, since
not all programs are routed through the daemon (only Secure Shell commands
are.)&nbsp; For example, below are three machines.&nbsp; I am on A, and want to
send a file to C securely.&nbsp; I have many options, but I choose to use <b>ftp
</b>(the same could be said of <b>telnet</b> as well), thinking that since I
have Secure Shell, I am safe (how foolish of me!!)</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Thus, the packets that A (as root) sends to C through B may look
like:</p>
<p align="left"><tt><u>4500 0035 051f 4000 4006 0b6c 813e 93dd</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where:</tt><br>
<tt><u>813e 93de</u> <font color="#ff0000">0418 0017 0d14 d5f0 1a2a
4993&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><u>xxxx</u>
is the IP header</tt><br>
<tt><font color="#ff0000">8018 7d78 0c64 0000 0101 080a 0445 6991&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yyyy </font>is the TCP header</tt><br>
<tt><font color="#ff0000">0446 d591 </font>30&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
zzzz is the packet data</tt><br>
</p>
<p align="left">Each time you sent the packet with the data &quot;0&quot;, you
would get a similar packet (the only differences would be in the IP and TCP
headers.)&nbsp; The hexadecimal number &quot;30&quot; would appear every time,
no matter the user or time or machine or whether the ssh2 daemon is
running.&nbsp; Therefore, machine B could &quot;sniff&quot; the packets going
across his router to learn any information that he/she wanted, even though both
A and C have security measures in force.</p>
<p align="left">Clearly, there is no security in this method - any schmoe can
figure out passwords this way.&nbsp; Therefore, it is imperative to use ssh2 and
sftp for all network needs.</p>
