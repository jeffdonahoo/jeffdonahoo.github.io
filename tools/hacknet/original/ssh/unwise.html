<p align="center"><b><font size="5">How NOT to Use the Secure Shell</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="5">(and other unwise/foolish acts)</font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just because you have secure shell on your machine does
NOT mean that you have a secure machine.&nbsp; It just means that you have the <u>potential</u>
of having secure connections across the network.&nbsp; Unless insecure commands
(such as <b>telnet</b>, <b>ftp</b>, <b>rlogin</b>, <b>rsh</b>, and <b>rcp</b>)
are disabled from your host machine, then anyone can [foolishly] connect to the
server using clear text to convey information such as login name, password, and
any other data necessary for the login process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To prove this, this <a href="http://ada.baylor.edu/stu/vanhorn/ssh/demo1.html">demonstration</a>
shows the effect of running <b>telnet</b> from a machine running <b>sshd2</b>
(the Secure Shell daemon) to another machine also running the <b>sshd2</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, this is not good, and we want to do something
about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If our goal is to have a machine that is relatively secure
in its actions across the network, then we will have to disable the insecure
commands as <i>root</i> and allow only the <b>ssh2</b> commands to work.&nbsp;
Once we have done that, we should be left with a system that will only enable
users to connect to (or from) a machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is one more problem, though, and that occurs when
the server uses a login scheme where it puts the login screen on several
terminals.&nbsp; Login names and passwords are sent across the network via clear
text.&nbsp; Thus, anyone can still sniff the passwords off that type of
network.&nbsp; However, Secure Shell was not intended to prevent this type of
security.&nbsp; Instead, Secure Shell was meant to make a secure connection from
a secure machine to another secure machine.</p>
