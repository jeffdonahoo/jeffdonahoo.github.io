<p align="left">Tripwire is a file integrity checker, a utility that compares a
designated set of files against information stored in a previously generated
database. Any differences are flagged and logged. When run against system files
on a regular basis, any changes in critical system files will be spotted -- and
appropriate damage control measures can be taken immediately. With Tripwire,
system administrators can conclude with a high degree of certainty that a given
set of files remain free of unauthorized modifications if Tripwire reports no
changes.</p>
<p align="left">Tripwire has two versions of their product, one that's free and
one that is commercial.&nbsp; The commercial release supports a fast
installation and optimized performance as well as keeping critical files in
binary format and cryptographically signed, and is Y2K compliant. The free
version, though, lacks all of the above, including being resource use
intensive.&nbsp; We downloaded the free version and tested it out.&nbsp; Our
results are <a href="results.html">here</a>.</p>
<p align="left">We highly recommend checking them out at <a href="http://www.tripwiresecurity.com/">http://www.tripwiresecurity.com/</a>.

<p align="left">One alternative is the Network Operating System Trinux, which
operates on top of an existing OS, such as Linux or Windows, but the problem is
that it was written the binaries are compatible with Red Hat Linux 5.2, not Red
Hat Linux 6.0.&nbsp; However, we have heard good things about it, and suggest
that you check them out at <a href="http://www.trinux.org/">http://www.trinux.org/</a>.
