<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">I.&nbsp; Downloading and Compiling</font></p>
<p>In order to run our simulation with tripwire, we first had to download
it.&nbsp; Downloadable versions are available at <a href="http://www.tripwiresecurity.com/">http://www.tripwiresecurity.com/</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once downloaded, we read the README file that accompanied the download.&nbsp;
The README file gave rather good instructions on how to compile the Tripwire
program to run on our Linux machine, although we did run into problems when it
required yacc and lex.&nbsp; We solved the problem by downloading the
aforementioned files from our real server for the Computer Science Department
here at Baylor.&nbsp; We ran into compilation errors with symbols redefined, but
we used the precompiler command <b>#ifdef</b> to comment out the tripwire's
redefinitions.</p>
<p><font size="4">II. Tailoring, Initializing, and Testing</font></p>
<p>The README file explained how to tailor the program to keep a database on any
file (i.e., make sure that these files have not been tampered with.)&nbsp; We
used a dummy file, trip_test, to test the tripwire system.&nbsp; The file had
the following set of simple lines:</p>
<font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">
<p><i>hello</i></p>
<p><i>how</i></p>
<p><i>are</i></p>
<p><i>you</i></p>
<p><i>?</i></p>
</font>
<p>We ran the tripwire diagnostics and received the status that nothing had
changed.&nbsp; Everything seemed set to go for our &quot;hacking&quot; test.</p>
<p>We decided now to proceed and &quot;hack&quot; into the system using a
&quot;stolen&quot; password using telnet to gain access.&nbsp; We changed the
file by adding a single x to the beginning of the file, so that it now looked
like:</p>
<font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">
<p><i>xhello</i></p>
<p><i>how</i></p>
<p><i>are</i></p>
<p><i>you</i></p>
<p><i>?</i></p>
</font>
<p><font size="4">III. Our Setup</font></p>
<p>We ran tripwire using only MD5 as a cryptographic signature for each file to
be watched.&nbsp; We also did not implement many of the safety features since we
are the hackers and we decided not test those aspects of security (for example,
the good people that brought us tripwire highly recommended that the tripwire
files be placed in a read-only disk or other read-only NFS mounted server.&nbsp;
Since we did not want to test this (since it deals with another issue entirely),
we did not implement this.)</p>
<p><font size="4">IV. Results</font></p>
<p>Now that the tripwire system had been installed and initialized, then
followed by the file tripwire is watching &quot;hacked&quot; into, we ran the
tripwire diagnostics.</p>
<p>The following message appeared:</p>

<p>This automatically lets me know that the &quot;system&quot; file has been
changed, by whom, when, the change in size, and the cryptographic signatures of
the two versions of the file.&nbsp; Notice that a single character changed the
signature completely.&nbsp; This makes it incredibly hard for a hacker to hack
the system without tripwire catching it.</p>
<p><font size="4">IV.&nbsp; Other Words</font></p>
<p>Several questions might be raised in the back of your mind.&nbsp; This
section will attempt to answer the most common.</p>
<p><b>1) How does one prevent a hacker from messing with the tripwire system?</b></p>
<p>The tripwire system should be moved to a read-only disk and only updated (the
disk must be switched to Read/Write) when the system is in single-user mode.</p>
<p><b>2) Using MD5 as the only cryptographic signature is rather safe, but I
need to be more safe.&nbsp; Can I do that?</b></p>
<p>The tripwire system can be configured to use a number of different
cryptographic methods, and in fact multiple methods can be used in order to have
a higher amount of confidence that your file(s) have not been hacked.&nbsp;
There is a cost, though, since each method requires a lot of time to derive the
signature.</p>
<p><b>3) How do I prevent hackers from changing files?</b></p>
<p>Tripwire does not prevent hackers from changing files, but instead alerts the
system administrator to files that <i>have</i> been hacked.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">V. Conclusions</font></p>

<p>Tripwire does an excellent job of keeping track of the natural state of the
system's files.&nbsp; Tripwire seems to be very portable, very useful, and
incredibly helpful in registering attacks. It should be </p>
