   <title>Telnet Session Between Moe and Curly without Secure Shell</title>
</head>
<body>
Here is how we
tested.&nbsp; The following list of actions was performed exactly in the
order in which the actions are numbered:
<ol>
<li>
First, we created a dummy user with user name <tt>lakov</tt> and password
<tt>01234.</tt>
on Curly.</li>

<li>
We run the command <tt>tcpdump -x -s 1000 | tee captured.telnet</tt> on
Larry.&nbsp; This command captures in hexadecimal mode the first 1000 bytes
of an IP packet, or the whole IP packet it if is smaller than 1000 bytes,
and prints the captured information both on the screen and into the file
<tt>captured.telnet</tt>
(the effect of the <tt>tee</tt> command.)</li>

<li>
We run the command <tt>telnet curly</tt> on <tt>Moe</tt>.&nbsp; When prompted
for a login name, we entered <tt>lakov</tt> and then when prompted for
a password, we entered <tt>01234.</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; You should keep in mind,
that the <tt>telnet</tt> program works in the following way (this is a
quick and dirty description): it establishes a TCP connection to the <i>telnet
server</i>, and when the user presses a button, the code for that button
is sent to the server, and a return command is sent back, which roughly
says "now you can print that letter on the screen."&nbsp; So, even if we
are able to capture the keystrokes, you should expect to see the user name
and the password in separate packets, one symbol per packet, rather than
together in one packet.</li>

<br>Finally, we logged on Curly.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the file <tt>captured.telnet</tt>
on Larry now contained the user name and the password.&nbsp; For brevity,
we decided to include only that part of <tt>captured.telnet</tt> which
shows how we can extract password, but we could have also included the
dump of the user name and any commands that the user typed after he/she
had gained access to the machine.&nbsp; Here is that specific part of captured.telnet
- first in its <a href="captured_telnet_raw_version.html">raw version</a>,
and then <a href="captured_telnet_annotated.html">annotated</a>.</ol>
