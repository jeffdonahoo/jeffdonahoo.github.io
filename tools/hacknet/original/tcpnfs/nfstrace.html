<b>nfstrace:</b>
<p>While snoop and tcpdump are designed as multipurpose network monitoring
utilities, nfstrace is primarily devoted to monitoring NFS traffic on the
network.
<br>nfstrace was developed by Matt Blaze of Princeton University to be
used as a portable toolkit for the creation of NFS trace data. The trace
data may be analyzed
<br>to produce a plausible set of client system calls corresponding to
the network activity, or may also be used as a representation of network
activity for
<br>experimentation purposes like testing cache efficiency. nfstrace is
interesting in that it attempts to reconstruct NFS activity into its higher
level of computer
<br>instructions. The usefulness of this information is limited, however,
due to the fact that nfstrace must do postmortem analysis of all its data
instead of on-the-fly and
<br>it provides no pathname information related to the files being remotely
accessed. nfstrace is mainly concerned general trace specific behavior
and leaves a lot to be
<br>seen about actual file transactions
