<b>snoop:</b>
<p>snoop behaves much in the same way as tcpdump in that it monitors network
traffic for selected packet types and allows the user to extract desired
information
<br>from their data. The main distinction of snoop is the extent of the
packet data that the user can examine, and an enhanced ``verbose'' mode
that parses header
<br>information to provide extensive information on packet structure. snoop
can display the complete contents of the packet and can display underlying
RPC, UDP,
<br>and, IP frame information if desired. This makes snoop more useful
than tcpdump in interpreting NFS transactions. However, file by file information
is not compiled
<br>by snoop since it operates independently upon each packet. snoop is
designed as a system administrator maintenance command
