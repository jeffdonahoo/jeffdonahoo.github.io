<!--  <H2> This is currently broken because the remailer I was using is no longer -->
<!--  in service.  Also, it appears that the popular remailer server software has  -->
<!--  changed so the syntax I use may be outdated.  The ideas are correct; however, -->
<!--  if you want this to work, you need to find a remailer (search for "remailer" -->
<!--  on your favorite search engine) and determine the correct syntax </H2> -->

Suppose you are madly in love with Pat<SUP>*</SUP> but too shy to announce this
directly.  You need some mechanism to anonymously communicate with
Pat to get a sense of Pat's feelings about a blind date.  Clearly,
talking to Pat is out of the question.  Calling is no good because
1) it is awkward, 2) you may just get an answering machine, and 3)
caller-id may negate anonymity.  Email is out because it exposes your
user ID, and if you spoof (fake) your email address as some
non-existent email address, Pat will be unable to respond to you.  What can
you do? <P>

<FONT size=-1> <SUP>*</SUP> The name Pat was selected due to its
inherent androgeny; therefore, this scenario can apply to males
or females. </FONT> <P>

Solution:  Anonymous Remailers <P>

Anonymous remailers email from Person A and forward it to Person B,
stripping all information that identifies the message as being from
Person A.  There are several types of anonymous remailers.  Mixmaster
appears to be the most popular; however, it requires special client
software.  We focus on the simplest anonymous remailer type called
Cyberpunk<SUP>+</SUP>.

<FONT size=-1> <SUP>+</SUP> Anonymity cannot be absolutely guaranteed
by any system.  Mixmaster does more than Cyberpunk to combat the
classical attack against anonymity.  Which type to use depends on how
you tradeoff complexity with anonymity.</FONT> <P>

The following links are good sources of information on remailers:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://anon.efga.org/Remailers">anon.efga.org</A>
<LI><A
HREF="http://www.skuz.net/potatoware/reli/UserMan.htm#Info">Remailer
User's Guide</A>
</UL>

One caveat when dealing with remailers is that they are not necessarily
reliable.  Abuse of remailers has resulted in legal actions against
remailing systems to seize machines and even shut them down.  This
makes it difficult to find an anonymous remailer when you need one.
To deal with this problem, various sites maintain lists of remailers,
which include statistics on operational and response time.  (See <A
HREF="http://anon.efga.org/Remailers">anon.efga.org</A> for one such
list source.)  These lists are quasi-standard.  They usually contain
two sections.  One list information on using the remailer:

<PRE>
$remailer{"xganon"} = "<remailer@anon.xg.nu> cpunk mix pgp remix latent hash cut test ek ekx esub inflt50 rhop20 post";
</PRE>

This remailer's id is xganon and its email address is
remailer@anon.xg.nu.  The list of terms after the email address
describe the remailer's capabilities.  For example, "cpunk" indicates
that this remailer does Cyberpunk, and "mix" indicates that this
remailer does Mixmaster.  The remailer list will contain
a dictionary for the other terms.  The next list provides statistics
on the remailer:

<PRE>
remailer  email address                        history  latency  uptime
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
xganon   remailer@anon.xg.nu              ############     5:11  99.97%
</PRE>

Read the list for details on interpreting the statistics.  Once you
have a remailer email address, you can directly ask it for help.  Send
email to the remailer's address with subject line
<i>remailer-help</i>.  Most remailers will return a document
describing their use.<P>

Below I describe 4 procedures for using the cyberpunk anonymous remailers for
communication, each adding functionality 
to the previous procedures.  I use a fictitious remailer at
<i>remailer@remailer.com</i> so you must find your own actual remailer
address.  The first procedure simply allows you to
send Bob an anonymous message.  The second procedure does the same
thing as 1, except that it allows the anonymous message to be
encrypted before it is sent to the remailer.  This will prevent anyone
from intercepting a "readable" message between you and the remailer
since the message, if intercepted before arriving at the remailer,
does identify you as the sender and Pat as the intended recipient.
The third procedure allows you to send anonymous email to Bob that Bob
can reply to WITHOUT compromising your identity.  The fourth and final
procedure adds encryption to the third procedure, just as the second
procedure added encryption to the first procedures.

<OL>
<LI>  Procedure to send an anonymous message to Bob.<P>
<OL>
<LI> Create an email message addressed to remailer@remailer.com.  Do not
fill in the subject line as it will be stripped off along with all
other header information.
<LI>  The body of the message should look something like the
following:

<pre>
::
Anon-To: bob@place.com
Latent-Time: +1:00
Cutmarks:  -XX-

##
Subject: This will be the subject Bob sees

This will be the message Bob sees

-XX-

Information below (and including) the -XX- will *NOT* be in the message
Bob sees.

</pre>

This message will be sent to the remailer at remailer@remailer.com.  The
:: in the message is a signal to the remailer that remailer
commands follow.  The :: must be the first characters in the first
line of the body of the message.  The Anon-To: command tells the
remailer to forward this email to bob@place.com.  If you are really
paranoid, the Latent-Time: command tells the remailer to hold off
forwarding the message for 1 hour.  This helps prevent Bob from
figuring out who sent the message by checking who was logged on to the
system when he received it.  The Cutmarks: command tells the remailer
to cutoff everything below where the cutmark occurs later in the
message.  In the example 
above, everything after the -XX- mark is deleted by the remailer
before it forwards the email to Bob.  Some mailers
automatically add a signature to the end of outgoing email which may
violate your anonymity.  The cutoff is a mechanism for chopping off
anything added to the end of the email.  All but the Anon-To: command
are optional. <B> You will probably want to eliminate the Latent-Time:
command when playing with anonymous remailers because your test
results will be delayed by an hour.</B><P>

The ## indicates the
beginning of the message.  A subject line immediately after it will
create a subject line for the message Bob receives.  Bob will receive
a message of the form:

<PRE>

To: bob@place.com
From: nobody@remailer.com
Subject: This will be the subject Bob sees

This will be the message Bob sees

</PRE>

Bob has no way of knowing who sent this message.  Replies will go to
nobody@remailer.com, an email black hole.  The problems with this
approach are 1) the message to the remailer, including the recipient,
goes in clear text to the remailer so it could be intercepted by Bob
and 2)  Bob has no way to reply to you. <P>

</OL>
<LI> Procedure to send an encrypted, anonymous letter to Bob,
avoiding interception prior to delivery of the email to the remailer
that would reveal your intent to send the letter to Bob.
<OL>
<LI> Constructs the very same message as in Procedure 1.
<LI> Encrypts with <A HREF="index.html#PGP">PGP</A> using
the public key of
the remailer.  The encryption should have an ASCII armor because
it will be emailed.  Of course, only the remailer can decrypt this
message. To get the public key of the remailer, send email to
remailer@remailer.com with the subject line <i>remailer-key</i><P>

Assuming the public key of the remailer can be found with the keyword
"remailer" and the email is in a file named bob, the PGP command-line is
<Pre>
pgp -ea remailer bob
</pre> 

This outputs the encrypted file to bob.asc.

<LI> Embed the encrypted file in an email to the remailer.
The embedded file is proceeded by the double colon and the command
"Encrypted: PGP":

The remailer receives this file, decrypts it, and processes it as it
would a clear-text file by forwarding to the specified recipient.
Note that the message does not reveal the contents or the intended
recipient in transit to the remailer.  This approach still has the
problem that Bob cannot communicate with you without sacrificing your
anonymity.

Bob where Bob can reply <b>without</b> knowing your identity.

<LI> Constructs an Encrypted Reply Block (ERB) containing the
necessary information to reply.  This information is encrypted with
the remailer's public key so only the remailer can determine a reply

<PRE>
::
Anon-To: you@place.com

<LI> Then encrypt (with ASCII armor) ERB.txt with the remailer's
public key.  Now only the remailer can decrypt the ERB.
