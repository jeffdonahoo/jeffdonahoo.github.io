<p>RCS (Revision Control System) is a good tool for controlling
revisions of programs and documents.  It allows a user to maintain a
catalog of revisions to a program and to "roll back" to a previous
revision.  It is well integrated with other UNIX tools such as emacs
and make. <P>

Consider the following scenario:  You have two files (a.c and b.c) in a
directory named stuff, and you want to control those files using RCS.
Here are the steps:

<OL>
<LI> In the stuff directory, create a directory named RCS.  This
directory will store the database of changes to your files.
<LI> Set the permission to allow rw priviledges to the correct users.
For example, if you are working with users in the UNIX group grad, the
permissions for a.c and b.c should be read and write for both user and
group (rw-rw----) and their group should be "grad".  The RCS and 
stuff directory should have read, write, and execute permissions for
both user and group (rwxrwx---) and their group should be "grad".
<LI> Now we must check the files into source control.  In the stuff
directory, type "ci a.c" and "ci b.c".  Each time you check in a file,
RCS asks you for a comment describing the changes you made.  If
you look in the RCS directory, you will see a.c,v and b.c,v.  These
are the files that RCS uses to record changes to a.c and b.c,
respectively.  Only in extreme circumstances would you edit or delete
these files.
<LI> If you just want to use a file (e.g., compile a.c), you can check
it out without a lock by typing "co a.c" in the stuff directory.  This
gives you a read-only copy of a.c that you can compile but not edit.
<B> WARNING: </B> By default when you check in a file in RCS, there is
no longer a copy of it in the stuff directory so to get a copy of it
back in the stuff directory you must check it out
without a lock to use it, even if you don't want to edit it.
<LI> If you want to edit a file, you check it out with a lock by
typing "co -l a.c" in the stuff directory.  Now you are the only person
who can edit that file.  When you are done, check it back in with "ci
a.c".  <B> WARNING: </B>  While you may be the only person who can
edit a locked file, other people may still use (e.g., compile) the file in
the stuff directory.  If your edits
temporarily "break" (e.g., no longer compiles) the file, it will interfer with others who are
using it; consequently, you may want to check it out with a lock, copy
and make changes to it in another location, and copy it back to the
stuff directory when edits are complete.
</OL>
