<h3>3.3&nbsp; Explanation of error messages from Memcheck</h3>

Despite considerable sophistication under the hood, Memcheck can only
really detect two kinds of errors, use of illegal addresses, and use
of undefined values.  Nevertheless, this is enough to help you
discover all sorts of memory-management nasties in your code.  This
section presents a quick summary of what error messages mean.

<h4>3.3.1&nbsp; Illegal read / Illegal write errors</h4>

For example:
<pre>
  Invalid read of size 4
     at 0x40F6BBCC: (within /usr/lib/libpng.so.2.1.0.9)
     by 0x40F6B804: (within /usr/lib/libpng.so.2.1.0.9)
     by 0x40B07FF4: read_png_image__FP8QImageIO (kernel/qpngio.cpp:326)
     by 0x40AC751B: QImageIO::read() (kernel/qimage.cpp:3621)
     Address 0xBFFFF0E0 is not stack'd, malloc'd or free'd
</pre>

<p>This happens when your program reads or writes memory at a place
which Memcheck reckons it shouldn't.  In this example, the program did
a 4-byte read at address 0xBFFFF0E0, somewhere within the
system-supplied library libpng.so.2.1.0.9, which was called from
somewhere else in the same library, called from line 326 of
qpngio.cpp, and so on.

<p>Memcheck tries to establish what the illegal address might relate
to, since that's often useful.  So, if it points into a block of
memory which has already been freed, you'll be informed of this, and
also where the block was free'd at.  Likewise, if it should turn out
to be just off the end of a malloc'd block, a common result of
off-by-one-errors in array subscripting, you'll be informed of this
fact, and also where the block was malloc'd.

<p>In this example, Memcheck can't identify the address.  Actually the
address is on the stack, but, for some reason, this is not a valid
stack address -- it is below the stack pointer, %esp, and that isn't
allowed.  In this particular case it's probably caused by gcc
generating invalid code, a known bug in various flavours of gcc.

<p>Note that Memcheck only tells you that your program is about to
access memory at an illegal address.  It can't stop the access from
happening.  So, if your program makes an access which normally would
result in a segmentation fault, you program will still suffer the same
fate -- but you will get a message from Memcheck immediately prior to
this.  In this particular example, reading junk on the stack is
non-fatal, and the program stays alive.


<h4>3.3.2&nbsp; Use of uninitialised values</h4>
For example:
<pre>
  Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
     at 0x402DFA94: _IO_vfprintf (_itoa.h:49)
     by 0x402E8476: _IO_printf (printf.c:36)
     by 0x8048472: main (tests/manuel1.c:8)
     by 0x402A6E5E: __libc_start_main (libc-start.c:129)

</pre>

<p>An uninitialised-value use error is reported when your program uses
a value which hasn't been initialised -- in other words, is undefined.
Here, the undefined value is used somewhere inside the printf()
machinery of the C library.  This error was reported when running the
following small program:
<pre>
  int main()
  {
    int x;
    printf ("x = %d\n", x);
  }
</pre>

<p>It is important to understand that your program can copy around
junk (uninitialised) data to its heart's content.  Memcheck observes
this and keeps track of the data, but does not complain.  A complaint
is issued only when your program attempts to make use of uninitialised
data.  In this example, x is uninitialised.  Memcheck observes the
value being passed to _IO_printf and thence to _IO_vfprintf, but makes
no comment.  However, _IO_vfprintf has to examine the value of x so it
can turn it into the corresponding ASCII string, and it is at this
point that Memcheck complains.

<p>Sources of uninitialised data tend to be:
<ul>
  <li>Local variables in procedures which have not been initialised,
      as in the example above.</li><p>

  <li>The contents of malloc'd blocks, before you write something
      there.  In C++, the new operator is a wrapper round malloc, so
      if you create an object with new, its fields will be
      uninitialised until you (or the constructor) fill them in, which
      is only Right and Proper.</li>

</ul>



<h4>3.3.3&nbsp; Illegal frees</h4>
For example:
<pre>
  Invalid free()
     at 0x4004FFDF: free (vg_clientmalloc.c:577)
     by 0x80484C7: main (tests/doublefree.c:10)
     by 0x402A6E5E: __libc_start_main (libc-start.c:129)
     by 0x80483B1: (within tests/doublefree)
     Address 0x3807F7B4 is 0 bytes inside a block of size 177 free'd
     at 0x4004FFDF: free (vg_clientmalloc.c:577)
     by 0x80484C7: main (tests/doublefree.c:10)
     by 0x402A6E5E: __libc_start_main (libc-start.c:129)
     by 0x80483B1: (within tests/doublefree)
</pre>
<p>Memcheck keeps track of the blocks allocated by your program with
malloc/new, so it can know exactly whether or not the argument to
free/delete is legitimate or not.  Here, this test program has
freed the same block twice.  As with the illegal read/write errors,
Memcheck attempts to make sense of the address free'd.  If, as
here, the address is one which has previously been freed, you wil
be told that -- making duplicate frees of the same block easy to spot.


<h4>3.3.4&nbsp; When a block is freed with an inappropriate
deallocation function</h4>

In the following example, a block allocated with <code>new[]</code>
has wrongly been deallocated with <code>free</code>:
<pre>
  Mismatched free() / delete / delete []
     at 0x40043249: free (vg_clientfuncs.c:171)
     by 0x4102BB4E: QGArray::~QGArray(void) (tools/qgarray.cpp:149)
     by 0x4C261C41: PptDoc::~PptDoc(void) (include/qmemarray.h:60)
     by 0x4C261F0E: PptXml::~PptXml(void) (pptxml.cc:44)
     Address 0x4BB292A8 is 0 bytes inside a block of size 64 alloc'd
     at 0x4004318C: __builtin_vec_new (vg_clientfuncs.c:152)
     by 0x4C21BC15: KLaola::readSBStream(int) const (klaola.cc:314)
     by 0x4C21C155: KLaola::stream(KLaola::OLENode const *) (klaola.cc:416)
     by 0x4C21788F: OLEFilter::convert(QCString const &amp;) (olefilter.cc:272)
</pre>
The following was told to me be the KDE 3 developers.  I didn't know
any of it myself.  They also implemented the check itself.
<p>
In C++ it's important to deallocate memory in a way compatible with
how it was allocated.  The deal is:
<ul>
<li>If allocated with <code>malloc</code>, <code>calloc</code>,
    <code>realloc</code>, <code>valloc</code> or
    <code>memalign</code>, you must deallocate with <code>free</code>.

<li>If allocated with <code>new[]</code>, you must deallocate with
    <code>delete[]</code>.
<li>If allocated with <code>new</code>, you must deallocate with
    <code>delete</code>.
</ul>
The worst thing is that on Linux apparently it doesn't matter if you
do muddle these up, and it all seems to work ok, but the same program
may then crash on a different platform, Solaris for example.  So it's
best to fix it properly.  According to the KDE folks "it's amazing how
many C++ programmers don't know this".  
<p>
Pascal Massimino adds the following clarification:
<code>delete[]</code> must be called associated with a

<code>new[]</code> because the compiler stores the size of the array
and the pointer-to-member to the destructor of the array's content
just before the pointer actually returned.  This implies a
variable-sized overhead in what's returned by <code>new</code> or
<code>new[]</code>.  It rather surprising how compilers [Ed:
runtime-support libraries?] are robust to mismatch in
<code>new</code>/<code>delete</code>
<code>new[]</code>/<code>delete[]</code>.


<h4>3.3.5&nbsp; Passing system call parameters with inadequate
read/write permissions</h4>

Memcheck checks all parameters to system calls.  If a system call
needs to read from a buffer provided by your program, Memcheck checks
that the entire buffer is addressible and has valid data, ie, it is
readable.  And if the system call needs to write to a user-supplied
buffer, Memcheck checks that the buffer is addressible.  After the
system call, Memcheck updates its administrative information to
precisely reflect any changes in memory permissions caused by the
system call.

<p>Here's an example of a system call with an invalid parameter:
<pre>
  #include &lt;stdlib.h>
  #include &lt;unistd.h>
  int main( void )
  {
    char* arr = malloc(10);
    (void) write( 1 /* stdout */, arr, 10 );
    return 0;
  }
</pre>

<p>You get this complaint ...
<pre>
  Syscall param write(buf) contains uninitialised or unaddressable byte(s)
     at 0x4035E072: __libc_write
     by 0x402A6E5E: __libc_start_main (libc-start.c:129)
     by 0x80483B1: (within tests/badwrite)
     by &lt;bogus frame pointer> ???
     Address 0x3807E6D0 is 0 bytes inside a block of size 10 alloc'd
     at 0x4004FEE6: malloc (ut_clientmalloc.c:539)
     by 0x80484A0: main (tests/badwrite.c:6)
     by 0x402A6E5E: __libc_start_main (libc-start.c:129)
     by 0x80483B1: (within tests/badwrite)
</pre>

<p>... because the program has tried to write uninitialised junk from
the malloc'd block to the standard output.

<h4>3.3.6&nbsp; Overlapping source and destination blocks</h4>
The following C library functions copy some data from one memory block
to another (or something similar): <code>memcpy()</code>,
<code>strcpy()</code>, <code>strncpy()</code>, <code>strcat()</code>,
<code>strncat()</code>.  The blocks pointed to by their <code>src</code> and

<code>dst</code> pointers aren't allowed to overlap.  Memcheck checks
for this.
<p>
For example:
<pre>
==27492== Source and destination overlap in memcpy(0xbffff294, 0xbffff280, 21)
==27492==    at 0x40026CDC: memcpy (mc_replace_strmem.c:71)
==27492==    by 0x804865A: main (overlap.c:40)
==27492==    by 0x40246335: __libc_start_main (../sysdeps/generic/libc-start.c:129)
==27492==    by 0x8048470: (within /auto/homes/njn25/grind/head6/memcheck/tests/overlap)
==27492== 
</pre>
<p>
You don't want the two blocks to overlap because one of them could get
partially trashed by the copying.
