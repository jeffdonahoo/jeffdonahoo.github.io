<P>
The LaTeX command typesets a file of text using the TeX program and the
LaTeX Macro package for TeX.  To be more specific, it processes an input
file containing the text of a document with interspersed commands that
describe how the text should be formatted.  It produces at least three
files as output:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>
A ``Device Independent'', or `<CODE>.dvi</CODE>' file. This contains commands that
can be translated into commands for a variety of output devices.  You
can view the output of LaTeX by using a program such as <CODE>xdvi</CODE>,
which actually uses the `<CODE>.dvi</CODE>' file.
<LI>
A ``transcript'' or `<CODE>.log</CODE>' file that contains summary information and
diagnostic messages for any errors discovered in the input file.
<LI>
An ``auxiliary'' or `<CODE>.aux</CODE>' file. This is used by LaTeX itself, for
things such as sectioning.
</OL>
