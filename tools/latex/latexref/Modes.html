<H2>2.14: Modes</H2>
<P>
When LaTeX is processing your input text, it is always in one of three
modes:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Paragraph mode
<LI>
Math mode
<LI>
Left-to-right mode, called LR mode for short
</UL>

<P>
LaTeX changes mode only when it goes up or down a staircase to a
different level, though not all level changes produce mode changes.
Mode changes occur only when entering or leaving an environment, or when
LaTeX is processing the argument of certain text-producing commands.
</P>
<P>
``Paragraph mode'' is the most common; it's the one LaTeX is in when
processing ordinary text.  In that mode, LaTeX breaks your text into
lines and breaks the lines into pages.  LaTeX is in ``math mode'' when
it's generating a mathematical formula.  In ``LR mode'', as in paragraph
mode, LaTeX considers the output that it produces to be a string of
words with spaces between them.  However, unlike paragraph mode, LaTeX
keeps going from left to right; it never starts a new line in LR mode.
Even if you put a hundred words into an <CODE>\mbox</CODE>, LaTeX would keep
typesetting them from left to right inside a single box, and then
complain because the resulting box was too wide to fit on the line.
</P>
<P>
LaTeX is in LR mode when it starts making a box with an <CODE>\mbox</CODE>
command.  You can get it to enter a different mode inside the box - for
example, you can make it enter math mode to put a formula in the box.
There are also several text-producing commands and environments for
making a box that put LaTeX in paragraph mode.  The box make by one of
these commands or environments will be called a <CODE>parbox</CODE>.  When
LaTeX is in paragraph mode while making a box, it is said to be in
``inner paragraph mode''.  Its normal paragraph mode, which it starts out
in, is called ``outer paragraph mode''.
