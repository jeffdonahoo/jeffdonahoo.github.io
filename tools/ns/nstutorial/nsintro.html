<P>
Since you have found this page, I assume that you already know what ns is
and where you can get it from. If not, I suggest you either go to the
<A HREF="http://netweb.usc.edu/vint/">web page for the VINT project</A>
or the <A HREF="http://www-mash.CS.Berkeley.EDU/ns/ns.html">web page for
ns (version 2)</A>. Note: In these pages I describe ns version 2.
<A HREF="http://www-nrg.ee.lbl.gov/ns/">Version 1</A> is different,
though there is a backwards compatibility library in version 2.
</P>

<P>
The purpose of these pages is to make it easier for new ns users to use
ns and nam, to create their own simulation scenarios for these tools and
to eventually add new functionality to ns. I have found the 
<A HREF="nsdoc.html">existing documentation</A> to be rather useful 
for users who already know the basic features of ns, while it can 
be a bit tedious for new users to extract the necessary information 
from the manuals and the example scripts. In this tutorial I will 
lead you through some simple examples, introducing more and more 
new features as we go along. The ultimate goal is that after a
short time you are able to efficiently use ns and to find any further
information you might need in the existing documentation. For this purpose
I will also try to tell you where I found the information in this tutorial 
myself, so you not only learn how to use ns, but also how to use its
documentation.
</P>

<P>
The web is probably the best medium for a tutorial like this, because
it's not only possible to add pictures (or even animations) for the 
examples, but you can also directly download the examples if you don't
have the time for typing them in yourself (though I would suggest doing
that at least for the first few examples). I chose a frame-oriented
design for these pages, since it makes them easier to navigate. If you
find that the left frame with the contents takes up too much room or if
you just don't like frames, you can switch to a 
<A HREF="nsindex.html" TARGET="_top">frameless version</A>.
</P>

<P>
Please understand that I can not give you a full reference manual for ns 
here, or a full Tcl/C++ tutorial, and that in a simple tutorial like this I 
can not help you with special problems like installation problems. There are 
better sources for that which I am going to list in 
<A HREF="nsdoc.html">Section II.</A>
</P>

<P>
I am still fairly new to ns myself and these pages represent my current 
knowledge about ns. It is definitely possible that many of the examples 
that I provide here could be improved. If you have any suggestions, 
and also if you have any new (well-documented) examples that could be 
added here, please <A HREF="mailto:greis@cs.uni-bonn.de">
send me some email</A>.
