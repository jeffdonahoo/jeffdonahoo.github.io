<P>
In this section I am going to list some sources for documentation for ns
and related packages. If you know any other sources, or if any of the links
have expired, please <A HREF="mailto:greis@cs.uni-bonn.de">email me</A>.

<A NAME="ns"><A>
<P>
<STRONG>II.1. Documentation for ns&nam</STRONG><BR>
The following documentation for ns and nam is available from the 
<A HREF="http://www-mash.cs.berkeley.edu/ns/">main ns web page</A>
at UCB.
</P>
<UL>
 <LI><A HREF="http://www-mash.cs.berkeley.edu/ns/nsDoc.ps.gz">"ns Notes
  and Documentation"</A> could be called the "main manual" for ns and is
  available in Postscript format.
 <LI>A manual page for ns is included in the distribution in the ns
  directory. There is a HTML-ized version 
  <A HREF="http://www-mash.cs.berkeley.edu/ns/ns-man.html">here</A>,
  but it might be out-dated.
 <LI>There is also a manual page for nam which is located in the nam
  directory in the distribution. However I have not been able to find it
  on the web, but you can get an ASCII version from my site 
  <A HREF="nam.txt">here</A>.
 <LI>You can also get slides from the second ns workshop from 
  <A HREF="http://www-mash.cs.berkeley.edu/ns/ns-documentation.html">
  this page</A>. They don't really contain more information that the
  "ns Notes and Documentation" document, though I found it a bit easier
  to digest.
 <LI>If you can't get ns to compile, if it crashes, or if you have any
  other similar problems, take a look at the 
  <A HREF="http://www-mash.cs.berkeley.edu/ns/ns-problems.html">ns-problems
  page</A> before you ask on the mailing list.
 <LI>If you have any general questions about ns or nam, you can send them
  to the <A HREF="http://www-mash.cs.berkeley.edu/ns/ns-lists.html">ns-users
  mailing list</A>. If you're not sure if your question has been asked
  before, check the <A HREF="http://www-mash.cs.berkeley.edu/dist/archive/ns-users/">
  Archive</A> for the mailing list.

<A NAME="tcl"><A>
<P>
<STRONG>II.2. Documentation for Tcl</STRONG><BR>
Tcl is fairly simple and if you already have some programming skills,
you should be able to learn most of what you need for simple scenarios
as you go along. However, I will try to provide some interesting links
for the more ambitious users who are not willing (or able) to buy a Tcl
book.
</P>
<UL>
 <LI>The <A HREF="http://www.elf.org/tcltk-man-html/contents.htm">Tcl8.0/Tk8.0 Manual</A>
  is basically a collection of hypertext manual pages.
 <LI>A <A HREF="ftp://ftp.scriptics.com/pub/mirror/ftp.sunlabs.com/welch/tkbook.ps.gz">draft for a
  Tcl/Tk book</A> is available in postscript format for personal use. Only the 
  first 94 pages are relevant for Tcl, the rest of the book is about Tk and
  more complicated aspects of Tcl.
 <LI>I also found a short <A HREF="ftp://ftp.tns.lcs.mit.edu/pub/otcl/doc/tutorial.html">
  OTcl Tutorial</A>.
 <LI>Another good starting point for looking for Tcl documentation is
  the <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Programming_Languages/Tcl_Tk/">
  Yahoo Tcl/Tk category</A>.

<A NAME="cpp"><A>
<STRONG>II.3. Documentation for C++</STRONG><BR>
I'd like to note that you don't need <STRONG>any</STRONG> C++ programming 
knowledge unless you want to add new functionality to ns.
<UL>
 <LI>Perhaps the best source for learning C++ is the book
  <A HREF="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/3rd.html">"The C++ Programming
  Language"</A> by <A HREF="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/">Bjarne
  Stroustrup</A>.
 <LI>If you don't want to buy a book, you can take a look at this
  <A HREF="http://www.swcp.com/~dodrill/cppdoc/cpplist.htm">C++ tutorial</A>.
 <LI>You can find an ANSI C++ standard draft on
  <A HREF="http://www.cygnus.com/misc/wp/">this page</A>
 <LI>And again, if you want to look for information on the web yourself,
  check out <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Programming_Languages/C_and_C__/">
  Yahoo's C/C++ category</A>.
