We believe these answers to be correct; however, since they are not official answers from the NS developers, treat them with the appropriate level of distrust.

<li> How are colors assigned to packets? <P>

The colors are associated with the fid_ values in each packet header.
The default fid_ for each packet can be set on a per agent basis. You
should set fid_ in the agent creating the packet.  For example,
consider the following code snippets from <A HREF="mfec.tcl">
mfec.tcl</A>

<pre>
...
# Associate green with packet fid_ = 1 (sender)
$ns color 1 green 
...
# Create FEC Sender agent
set FECSnd [new Agent/FEC/Snd]
...
# Set packet ID of packets from sender
$FECSnd set fid_ 1
...
</pre>

This conclusion is based on the following message to the mailing list:

In nam trace file, every packet have an 'attribute' field, which is
produced by 'fid_' of data sources in your simulation scripts. The colors
defined by above commands builds a 1-1 mapping between colors to the
'fid's. Therefore, you may change the fid_ of your packets as a means to
label them with different colors.

You may find the details of nam trace file format in nam's man page.
Please let me know if you have further questions.

(Lingering question:  How do the default fid_ values get set
(e.g. 30/31 for prune/graft messages)?) <P>

<li>  How do I make losses occur on specific links? <P>

Here is a TCL <A HREF="loss.tcl">script</A> showing one way to use the
loss model. <P>

<LI>

It appears that in NAM the first person that opens up NAM on a particular gets all of the NAM windows, even if they are created by other users.  That is, if I am on AIM, I am running NAM, and Sunila tries to run NAM on AIM, her NAM windows will actually pop up on MY console.  Spooky.  <P>
<BR>
One possible solution<BR>
by expert TCL programmer, Sunila:<BR>
<BR>
1.  Go to the file anim-ctrl.tcl in the nam-1.0a7/tcl directory.<BR>
2.  Jump to function remote-create-animator<BR>
3.  Comment out the whole if/else statement<BR>
4.  Insert the following before the commented if/else statement:<BR>
<BR>
        puts -nonewline "Cannot connect to existing nam instance. "<BR>
        puts "Starting a new one..."<BR>
        $self local-create-animator $trace_file [join $args]<BR>
<BR>
You may notice that these are the lines in the "if" part of the if/else statement.<BR>
5.  In directory nam-1.0a7, type make.  This should recompile NAM so that every time you run it a NEW NAM console is created.<BR>
