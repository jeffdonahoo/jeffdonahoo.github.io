<p>NS is a great tool for simulating network agents.  It allows a
user to easily specify an arbitrary network with assigned attributes to
network elements (e.g., link speed).  The main NS site is <a
href="http://www-mash.CS.Berkeley.EDU/ns/">here</a>.

<p>Steps for using NS:
<ol>
<li>
Download the "allinone" copy from the main <A
HREF="http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/ns-build.html#allinone"> site</A>.
This contains a tarred/compressed version of everything (TCL, NS, TK,
...). </LI>

<li> Decompress/untar it in your home directory.  I suggest changing the
directory name from ns-allionone... to ns.  </LI>

<li> Change to the ns directory and run "./install".  This should
compile everything for you. </LI>

<li> Make sure you set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to point to the otcl shared
library.  If your ns installation is at /home/bob/ns, you need to
set the variable to /home/bob/ns/otcl.  Also make sure that /home/bob/ns/bin
is in your path.  This directory will hold links to all of the vital
binaries.</li>

<li> The ns directory contains everything (NS, TCL, ...).  Change to
the ns distribution directory (e.g., ns-2.26) and run "./validate" to
confirm your version works. </LI>

</ol>

There is a good NS <a
href="http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/tutorial/index.html">tutorial</a>.

<li>
Another good way to learn NS is to play with the example TCL files in /home/bob/ns/ns-2/tcl/ex. 
Try the simple.tcl file in that directory by typing "ns simple.tcl" in
the "ex" directory.  These TCL files show how to create a network,
use existing NS agents to perform a simulation, and create a nam (Network
Animator) animation of the simulation.  Note that tcl is interpreted
so you do not need to compile the scripts.  Just write the script
in a file (e.g., foo.tcl) and type "ns foo.tcl" to execute it.</li>

<li>
The main site also contains a <a href="http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/ns-documentation.html">manual</a>
on using NS.

<li> I have created an FEC agent.  You can download the code
and installation instruction from <A HREF="ns-example.html">here</A>.

<li> You can now <A
HREF="http://www-mash.cs.berkeley.edu/htdig/search.html">search</A>
the NS mailing list archives. 

<li> I maintain a <A HREF="BUFAQ.html">BU FAQ</A> where I try to log
answers that I found to various questions.

<li> A good way to learn about using existing agents to build
simulations is looking over the example files (e.g., simple.tcl) in the
ns/ns-<i>version</i>/tcl/ex directory.  You can interpret these files by using the
man page for ns (command: man ns).
