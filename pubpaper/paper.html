Demands on Internet services are growing at a phenomenal rate.  Over
its lifetime the Internet has sustained an exponential growth in the
number of users.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#figgrowth">1</A>
demonstrates the actual growth in the number of hosts<A NAME="tex2html2" HREF="#23"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/general_images/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> in the
Internet over the past five years[<A HREF="paper.html#ids97">12</A>].

<STRONG>Figure:</STRONG> <A NAME="figgrowth">&#160;</A> Growth of Internet Hosts<BR>
<P>
<P>
At this point, the Internet's growth has reached sufficient
mass to become a self-feeding.  Users lured by the wide
variety of available information and services can easily connect up to
the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs) such as America
Online (AOL).  The explosion of users encourages even more development
of new applications (e.g. RealNetworks, www.real.com).  This imposes a
vicious cycle 
of exponential growth on the Internet with more users begetting more
applications and more applications attracting more users.  In
addition, primordial Internet applications, such as email, demanded
little bandwidth<A NAME="tex2html3" HREF="#29"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/general_images/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>.
With the commercialization of the Internet, the bandwidth demands of
specific applications have grown considerably.  For example,
there are now Internet applications which stream video and audio at
bandwidths considerably higher than generated by the early Internet
applications.
<P>
While Internet demands continue to grow at a phenomenal rate because
of user population and application bandwidth requirement increases,
the infrastructure's capabilities are not keeping pace.  Some mechanisms must be
found to better utilize the existing bandwidth, if the Internet is to
sustain its current growth rate.  One such mechanism which has drawn
serious attention from industry and researchers is <EM>multicast</EM>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00011000000000000000">What is multicast?</A></H2>
<P>
Currently, Internet server applications utilize a point-to-point
connection protocol, called unicast (``uni'' means one; ``cast'' means
send) for communicating with client applications[<A HREF="paper.html#isi81">7</A>, <A HREF="paper.html#isi81a">8</A>];
consequently, for each new client, the server must establish, support,
and maintain a separate connection.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#figunicast">2</A>
represents the current unicast approach.
<P>
<P><A NAME="65">&#160;</A> <IMG WIDTH=614 HEIGHT=454 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="figure34" SRC="img3.gif"  > <BR>
<STRONG>Figure:</STRONG> <A NAME="figunicast">&#160;</A>Unicast Connections from Server to Clients<BR>
<P>
<P>
A new communication paradigm called multicast (``multi'' means many)
allows a server application to send a single message to multiple
recipients[<A HREF="paper.html#dee90">5</A>, <A HREF="paper.html#bra93">2</A>, <A HREF="paper.html#SRL96">9</A>].  The Internet, upon receiving the
message, is responsible for efficiently delivering the message to all
intended 
recipients.  Consider Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#figmulticast">3</A> which represents the
single multicast connection of a server to a set of clients.  Of
course in this 
case, unlike Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#figunicast">2</A>, all of clients receive the same
message.  This means that only application which are sending duplicate
data simultaneously to multiple clients can most effectively use
multicast.

<P><H2><A NAME="SECTION00012000000000000000">Why use multicast?</A></H2>
<P>
Multicast provides two distinct advantages over the current unicast
paradigm:
<P>
<DL ><DT><STRONG>Efficient Utilization:</STRONG>
<DD>  
Multicast communication provides Internet server applications the
ability to communicate more efficiently with very large groups of clients.
Consider the example of Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fignetmult">4</A>. 
The dashed lines of Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fignetmult">4</A> represent the messages
which must be sent over the Internet with the current unicast model.
The routers<A NAME="tex2html7" HREF="#49"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/general_images/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>
of the Internet (denoted by an X) are 
responsible for properly directing messages from a sender to a
receiver.  Note that some of the links in the network carry the
message twice because they are on the common path between the
sender and receivers.  On the other hand, consider the solid lines of
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fignetmult">4</A> which indicate the <EM>multicast</EM> of the
same message.  Note that on the common paths only one copy of the
message is sent.  Since fewer messages are needed, multicast is more
efficient than unicast.
<P>
<P><A NAME="69">&#160;</A> <IMG WIDTH=699 HEIGHT=458 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="figure52" SRC="img5.gif"  > <BR>
<STRONG>Figure:</STRONG> <A NAME="fignetmult">&#160;</A> Multicasting in Internet Routers<BR>
<P>
<P>
Consider Pointcast (www.pointcast.com) which makes a free
screen saver product that, along with advertisements, sends
information (e.g. stock prices, sports scores, etc.) to
tens-of-thousands of desktop computers.  These screen savers update
themselves every fifteen minutes by sending a request to a Pointcast
server.  Each request from each desktop
computer spawns the creation of a separate unicast connection from the
server to the client through the Internet to send the updates.  It is
estimated that approximately 30% of the current Internet traffic is
Pointcast related.
<P>
Much of the information sent by Pointcast servers to each client is
redundant.  That is, most Pointcast clients are after the same
information.  Instead of
maintaining a connection and resending this redundant information for
each client, the server can use multicast to send the message <B>
  once</B> to all the clients.  This saves significant Internet
bandwidth.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Application Enabler:</STRONG>
<DD>
Multicast enables applications which are not possible with unicast.
Consider a server with a 3 megabyte bandwidth connection to the
Internet.  If this server wants to send live video to the Internet and
the video requires 1 megabyte of bandwidth per second, the server can
at maximum service 3 simultaneous clients with unicast.  With
multicast, no matter how many clients are in the Internet, the
connection between the server and Internet need only carry 1 megabyte
of video per second.  Applications such as large-scale, live video
distribution which are currently not possible will be enabled with the
addition of multicast as an Internet service.
<P>
 </DL><H2><A NAME="SECTION00013000000000000000">Where is multicast?</A></H2>
<P>
While the multicast communication paradigm was specified in the
original Internet protocol[<A HREF="paper.html#isi81">7</A>], specification and
implementation of the necessary support in the network was not
performed.  In the early 1990's, researchers started work to add
multicast capabilities to limited regions of the Internet,
beginning with the establishment of an experimental multicast backbone
called the MBone[<A HREF="paper.html#eri94">6</A>].
<P>
Currently, Internet multicast messaging can only happen between
computers which are connected to the MBone.  Many otherwise impossible
services have been implemented on the MBone.  For example, users on
the MBone can 
attend a weekly ``Multimedia Seminars'' at Berkeley, interactively
participate in 
conferences, view the current contents
of a refrigerator in France, and even view a live concerts (e.g. 1996 Rolling Stones).  Currently, connectivity to the MBone is limited to research
institutions and very large corporations, and for the most part no
access is granted to 
ISP modem users.  Most modern computer equipment, including Internet
routers, are currently capable of supporting multicast.  The service
need only be ``turned on;'' however, most ISPs have multicast turned
off.
<P>
At this time, there is not agreed upon standard for implementing
multicast in the Internet.  The Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF), an Internet standards organization, is currently considering
several proposals[<A HREF="paper.html#wai88">11</A>, <A HREF="paper.html#bal93">1</A>, <A HREF="paper.html#dee95b">3</A>, <A HREF="paper.html#tha97">10</A>].  Proprietary
standards also exist, lending some confusion for ISP providers as to
which proposed standard to adopt.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">Scenario</A></H1>
<P>
While multicast is clearly an important technology in sustaining the
growth of the Internet,  its future is not so clear.  Many forces are
coming into play to determine when, if, and how it will be deployed.
The issues have become so important to corporations and government
agencies that a large, collaborative effort,  called the IP Multicast
Initiative (IPMI), has been formed to determine that fate of
multicast.  This organization (www.ipmulticast.com) has an impressive 
collection of some of the biggest players in the Internet including
Microsoft, AT&amp;T, IBM, and Sun.  Effectively, the goal of this
organization is to negotiate the implementation Internet-wide
multicast.  Since multicast will enable a more substantial growth in
Internet users and a new class of applications, each member of this
initiative has significant stakes in the outcome.  We consider each
type of ``player'' and their likely motivations:
<P>
<DL ><DT><STRONG>Software Providers:</STRONG>
<DD>  Microsoft, still stinging from its miss of
the desktop publishing revolution, thinks that the Internet is the
next big technology driver.  Initially, many of the ``cool'' Internet
applications existed only in the UNIX domain.  When the Internet went
commercial, Windows software providers spent years just
catching up with UNIX.  Microsoft wants Windows to become the platform
of Internet innovation, instead of a UNIX follower.  The multicast application
software base is still predominantly UNIX, but it is very immature.
In the area of multicast applications, Microsoft could easily catch
and surpass UNIX, becoming the premier platform from which to leverage
multicast Internet technology; consequently, Microsoft has a
significant interest in a ubiquitous, seamless<A NAME="tex2html8" HREF="#72"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/general_images/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> multicast environment
taking shape.  They have already integrated multicast functionality in
both Windows 95 and NT.  Other companies such as Precept (www.precept.com) want
to provide IP/TV (Internet television) for corporations.  Multicast
will enhance IP/TV's performance, increasing the demand for their
products.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Internet Hardware Providers:</STRONG>
<DD>  Companies like Fore, Novell,
Cisco, and 3Com provide the equipment which operates the Internet.
If the Internet and corporation intranets are to utilize multicast,
purchases of new switching hardware and software must be made.  The
transition to multicast will provide opportunities to charge for
replacement of legacy network systems and for greater product
differentiation (e.g. 3Com and Cisco have products tailored to enhance
the support of specific applications, such as voice transmission).
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Server Providers:</STRONG>
<DD>  While it is fine to purchase an inexpensive
computer for a user's desktop, Internet servers require significant
hardware resources.  Companies like HP, Sun, SGI, IBM,
and DEC have joined IPMI because newer, fancier applications usually
need greater server computation power.  These companies have considerable
investment in very powerful servers which would be well suited for
support of new multicast-enabled applications.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Internet Service Providers:</STRONG>
<DD>  ISPs are ``where the rubber meets
the road'' in the provision of multicast service.  Currently, most
ISPs are choosing not to enable multicast support for their clients
for two reasons.  First, ISPs fear the potential havoc that multicast
can reap on their networks.  Consider a user connected by a 14.4Kbps modem to
an ISP.  Without multicast, the user can generate at maximum 14.4Kbps
of data within the ISPs network.  With multicast, the 14.4Kbps stream
of data can grow exponentially within the network because the stream
can be replicated at each router.  Kilobit connections can quickly
grow to megabit bandwidth consumption.  Second, ISPs recognize that
this is an important technology enabling service for corporations;
therefore, they want to figure out how to charge for it, even if
overall enabling the service <B>saves</B> them bandwidth.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>End-User Hardware Providers:</STRONG>
<DD>  Processors for end-user computers
are rapidly increasing in power.  Companies, such as Intel, are
constantly searching for reasons to compel users to upgrade to
faster and faster processors.  The new class of applications enabled
by multicast will most likely require more powerful end-user
processing capabilities.  These
so called ``hybrid'' applications will provide upgrade processor
necessities for end-users; therefore, Intel has added its muscle in
support of multicast services.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>IP Software Services:</STRONG>
<DD> Multicast provides only the most
rudimentary functionality, namely best-effort delivery of data.
Packets of data in the Internet can be legally lost, duplicated, or
delivered out of order by multicast.  Software services must be
implemented on top of multicast to enable service such as reliable
delivery.  Software companies such as Starburst, Precept, and FTP
software need multicast to succeed for their products to be useful.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Government:</STRONG>
<DD>  The government effectively washed its hands of
responsibility for the Internet by privatizing it all in the last few
years (except, of course, for trying to regulate the Internet's
content).  Government organizations, such as NASA, have joined IPMI as
a user,
but they are no longer the controlling authority.  It is doubtful that
they will take a more active role in the future.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Standards Groups:</STRONG>
<DD>  Various collaborative standards groups such
as the IETF have defined many of the protocols in use in the Internet
today.  To maintain their relevance and maintain their research
revenue stream, these groups must work to make sure that their standards win
the multicast standards debate.  The MBone is currently operated on an
IETF standard.
<P>
 </DL><H2><A NAME="SECTION00021000000000000000">Scenario</A></H2>
<P>
<DL ><DT><STRONG>October, 1997:</STRONG>
<DD>  UUNet<A NAME="tex2html9" HREF="#77"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/general_images/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>
    introduces UUCast, a multicast service based on IETF open
    standards, to all their users.  Multicast senders must pay for a
    dedicated UUCast connection.  UUCast was initially used by CNN
    Interactive, Microsoft Network (MSN) Online service, and
    Audionet.  MCI's @ Home Network, utilizing <B>proprietary</B> protocols,
    also provides multicast service to subscribers.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>February, 1998:</STRONG>
<DD>  With the acquisition complete of MCI by Worldcom,
  MCI's proprietary multicast service is quietly put to rest
  and replaced by UUNet's (also a Worldcom subsidiary) UUCast.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>March, 1998:</STRONG>
<DD>  The IETF standardizes with PIM[<A HREF="paper.html#dee95">4</A>]
  for intradomain and GUM[<A HREF="paper.html#tha97">10</A>] for interdomain multicast
  routing.  Since IETF standards are utilized by the dominant ISP
  players, this opens the path for Internet hardware vendors to
  implement a standard multicast protocol for all future products.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>October, 1998:</STRONG>
<DD> Lacking ubiquity, multicasting remains in
  the large corporation domain as an efficient mechanism for
  dissemination of information such as CEO speeches and quarterly
  multimedia reports.  This only works for corporations with
  headquarters and branches all supported by the same ISP.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>December, 1998:</STRONG>
<DD>  The other large Internet backbone providers,
  under pressure from corporations, add multicast services of their
  own.  This attracts companies like Pointcast to make their product
  multicast capable, thus main streaming multicast for the masses.
  This first generation of ``cool'' multicast products attracts large
  numbers of users.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>April, 1999:</STRONG>
<DD>  Internet ISPs, which
  also support long-distance telephony, such as AT&amp;T and Sprint notice
  a loss of revenue as more and more companies use multicast
  service for remote collaboration instead of conference calls.
  Already inflamed by loss of revenue to Internet phones which the FCC
  seems unwilling to curtail, these companies turn to proprietary
  multicast services for their users.  Now AT&amp;T users can only send
  and receive AT&amp;T originated multicast traffic so that only AT&amp;T
  subscribers are using AT&amp;T networks for multicast.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>June, 1999:</STRONG>
<DD>  Telephony providers are quickly forced by private
  users and corporations to reverse their proprietary multicast
  policy.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>July, 1999:</STRONG>
<DD> Border skirmishes erupt when Internet providers
  begin to suffer congestion problems due to multicast traffic
  originating from another provider.  Recall that multicast
    traffic can grow exponentially as it is replicated at the Internet
    routers.  A single user in UUNet's domain can send 14.4Kbps of
    data which can grow to 50Mbps when sent to a large group of users
    in AT&amp;T's domain.  This upsets AT&amp;T because it is supporting
    large traffic volumes for which it is not compensated.  Since
    UUNet started the multicasting Internet service, it has
    significantly more multicast senders
    than AT&amp;T.  Since ISPs only get paid by the senders, AT&amp;T
    clearly loses in this environment since it has to carry, for free,
    UUNet's revenue generating multicast streams.  AT&amp;T responds by
    establishing a multicast traffic tariff.  Those senders refusing to pay
    the tariff have their multicast traffic dropped.  Users are
    furious at being unable to receive certain choice multicast
    transmissions.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>August, 1999:</STRONG>
<DD> The IETF,
    fighting to maintain relevance now that multicast has entered the
    corporate world, begins issuing the ``Good Netkeeping Seal'' which
    informs users as to which ISPs provide standard, uninterrupted
    multicast service.  AT&amp;T begins losing customers and is forced to
    drop its tariffs.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>November, 1999:</STRONG>
<DD>  The second generation of multicast applications
  emerge in time for Christmas, including large-scale, interactive
  games.  Some games create virtual environments in which thousands
  can play simultaneously around the world,
  spawning international competitions.  WebTV becomes a reality,
  allowing broadcasters to operate outside of the FCC's control.
  The major networks scramble to create Web stations.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>March, 2000:</STRONG>
<DD>  Corporate America has succeeded in turning the
  Internet into a new broadcast medium.  The predominant traffic comes
  from so called ``push applications'' which only transmit sender
  determined (similar to TV) information.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>January, 2005:</STRONG>
<DD>  Until now <B>sending</B> multicast was cost
  prohibitive to all but corporations.  (Of course, <B>receiving</B>
  multicast was always free.)  A growing number of
  underground ``virtual'' multicast providers have allowed individuals
  to access the power of multicast to erect non-commercial TV and
  radio stations.  A few desperate ISPs allow individuals to begin
  sending multicast, opening up a new generation of multicast
  applications which are more than just passive receivers.
<P>
 </DL><H2><A NAME="SECTION00022000000000000000">Alternate Scenario</A></H2>
<P>
The following is a tongue-in-cheek possible fast path scenario:
<P>
Bill Gates wants to make Windows the preeminent platform for the new
era in Internet multicast applications.  Recognizing the need to act
swiftly, he decides to <B>force</B> ISPs to use multicast.  He includes
Precepts IP/TV in Windows 98<A NAME="tex2html10" HREF="#86"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/general_images/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>.  He then hires
Jenny McCarthy (Playboy's 
1996 Playmate of the Year) and Brad Pitt (People Magazine's Sexiest
Man Alive) to provide prime time evening content.  For those without
multicast, Bill simulates it with unicast streams; however, the quality is
poor because the ISPs infrastructure cannot handle each user getting
their own, private stream of video.  Bill Gates educates the
public that if only their ISP supported multicast, the quality would
significantly improve.  A vicious private user mob and corporations
wanting to cash in on applications for the new technology force multicast's
immediate adoption by ISPs.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">Commentary</A></H1>
<P>
Multicast provides one of the best mechanisms for sustaining the
current growth of the Internet by allowing the efficient delivery of a
single message to thousands of recipients.  Not only does multicast
improve the performance of existing applications, but it enables
previously intractable applications.  The Internet contains a
sufficient user base that success with a new technology has the
potential of creating significant wealth for any company providing a widely
accepted solution.  Multicast sets the ground work for future so
called ``killer applications'' (e.g. Netscape).
<P>
The emergence of multicast will be influenced by four main forces:
<P>
<DL ><DT><STRONG>ISPs:</STRONG>
<DD> ISPs,
rightfully, fear the consequences of ``turning multicast on'' on their
network performance.  In addition, they have not yet decided how they
are going to maximally charge for this service.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Support Providers:</STRONG>
<DD> Support providers such as
Microsoft and Sun eagerly await the next generation of Internet
applications.  Past trends indicate that each successive generation only
increases the requirement for complex software and hardware.
Undoubtedly a successful introduction of multicast to the Internet
will create a demand for newer and faster components.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Standards Groups:</STRONG>
<DD>  Before 
commercialization, the attitude of Internet denizens was entirely
cooperative (hence the evolution of ``netiquette'').  Proposed standards
were published and debated in public forums before deployment.
Businesses historically have been resistant to such an approach
because it is slow and uncontrollable.  Standards organizations must
fight to maintain relevance because businesses will be tempted to
establish de facto standards by flooding the Internet with their
software.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Users:</STRONG>
<DD>  The users of the Internet seems to have an
insatiable appetite for new applications.  In addition, businesses
are now discovering the cost efficiency of utilizing the Internet for
more than email; consequently, they are building massive knowledge
sharing servers which use the Internet.  Some businesses are even
turning to the Internet to replace existing services such as
telephony.  Users, both individual and corporate, will be a powerful
force in determining the multicast landscape.
