Overlay networks typically do not provide admission control for
membership.  This allows unauthorized members to both produce and
consume services on the overlay.  We can secure communication in two
ways: overlay access control and data encryption.

We develop an authorization technique that allows existing overlay
nodes to determine if their neighbors are legitimate and kick them out
if they are not.

<font  class="sectiontitle"><a href="encryption">Data Encryption</a></font><br />

If we cannot control access to the overlay, we encrypt the data with a
key known only to the legitimate members of the overlay.  While rogue
nodes can easily join the overlay and receive data, they cannot
decrypt the data.
