The purpose of the P4P project is to construct overlay network
services for use by P2P applications.  We are focusing our efforts in
a few key areas:  Routing Services, Transport Protocols, Security, and
Applications. 

<p />

<font class="sectiontitle"><a href="routing">Routing Service</a></font><br />

In practice, the Internet provides application with one simple message
delivery service, unicast.  While other services have been proposed
for IP, none have been widely deployed.  Since we control the
infrastructure in overlay networks, we can now deploy these novel
services.  We are developing overlay networks that
can provide data delivery services such as broadcast, multicast,
subcast, and concast.

<p />

<font  class="sectiontitle">Transport</font><br />

We extend the minimal, best-effort overlay routing services to provide
the protocol semantics expected by applications.

<p />

<font  class="sectiontitle"><a href="security">Security</a></font><br />

Most overlay architectures do not provide either group or data access
control mechanisms.  We are developing security mechanisms to secure
data via encryption and to control overlay admission.

<p />

<font class="sectiontitle">Application</font><br />

Overlays provide the opportunity to deploy novel networking services;
however, existing applications are not designed to utilize these
services.  We are exploring the extension of existing applications to
take advantage of these new services.
