<!--#INCLUDE VIRTUAL="shared/header.html" -->

An overlay network consists of a set of nodes with virtual
connections.  A virtual connection consists of a series of one or more
physical network hops.  Node interconnectivity is determined by the
particular overlay protocol, and this interconnectivity may evolve
over time to improve the overlay performance.
